# Excess Mortality Attributed to Heat and Cold (2023; Masselot et al.)

## Background for Study

- **Goal**: Comprehensive and robust mortality impact assessment.
- **Context**: Both heat and cold are established risk factors with numerous studies on the subject.
- Previous studies often focus on country-specific data or miss important factors.
- Referenced Studies:
  - Global, regional, and national burden of mortality associated with non-optimal ambient temperatures from 2000 to 2019 (2021; Zhao Q, Guo Y, Ye T, et al.)
  - Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature (2015; Gasparrini et al.)
  - Temperature-related mortality: a systematic review and investigation of effect modifiers (2019; Son J-Y, Liu JC, Bell ML.)

## Added Value

### General

- **Unprecedented City Coverage**: Covers 854 urban areas across Europe, offering a more comprehensive assessment than prior studies focused on specific countries or regions.
- **Focus on Both Heat and Cold**: Provides a balanced assessment of both heat and cold impacts, offering a more complete picture of temperature-related health risks.
- **Age-Specific and Standardized Analysis**: Models age-specific risks and provides age-standardized mortality rates, highlighting the heightened vulnerability of the elderly.
- **Integration of Vulnerability Factors**: Incorporates a wide range of city-specific socioeconomic, infrastructural, and environmental characteristics to create composite vulnerability indices.

### Comparison

| Feature                       | Zhao et al. (2021)            | Masselot et al. (2023)               | Added Benefit of Masselot et al. (2023)                       |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Geographical Scope**        | Global (750 locations in 43 countries) | Europe (854 cities in 30 countries)   | More detailed focus on a specific region.                      |
| **Temporal Scope**            | 2000-2019                     | 2000-2019                            | Allows direct comparison of results.                           |
| **Exposure Data**             | Gridded temperature data (0.5Â° x 0.5Â°) | ERA5-Land reanalysis data (9 km resolution) | Higher resolution data provides more accurate exposure assessment. |
| **Outcome Data**              | Daily all-cause or non-external mortality counts | Daily all-cause or non-accidental mortality counts, with age-specific data for a subset of cities | Inclusion of age-specific mortality data allows for nuanced analysis. |
| **Modeling Framework**        | Three-stage: time-series regression, meta-regression, prediction | Three-stage: quasi-Poisson regression with DLNM, meta-regression with PLS, kriging interpolation | Incorporation of PLS for dimensionality reduction and kriging for spatial interpolation. |
| **Vulnerability Assessment**  | Limited to 5 meta-predictors | Includes 22 city-specific characteristics | Comprehensive assessment of vulnerability factors. |
| **Age-Specific Analysis**     | Not explicitly mentioned      | Provides age-specific relative risks and age-standardized mortality rates | More targeted understanding of vulnerable age groups.         |

## Limitations

- **Geographical Extrapolation**: Extrapolation of exposure-response functions (ERFs) across European cities may introduce bias, especially in less covered areas like Eastern Europe.
- **Age-Specific Limitations**: Could not reliably estimate ERFs for people younger than 20 years due to low death counts, limiting the analysis to broader age bands for younger populations.

## Findings

- **Headline Figures**:
  - Annual excess of 203,620 (95% CI 180,882-224,613) deaths due to cold.
  - Annual excess of 20,173 (95% CI 17,261-22,934) deaths due to heat.
  - Age-standardized excess death rates of 129 (95% CI 114-142) per 100,000 person-years for cold and 13 (95% CI 11-14) per 100,000 person-years for heat.
- **Key Message**: Non-optimal temperatures have a substantial impact on mortality in European cities, with cold being a much larger contributor than heat. Results varied across Europe and age groups, with the highest effects in eastern European cities. Vulnerability increases with age, especially for the elderly (85+ years).

# Methods

## Overview

- Quasi-Poisson Time Series Model
- Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model (DLNM)
- Quadratic B-Spline
- Cubic Natural Spline
- Meta-Regression
- Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression
- Natural Spline (ns)
- Multivariate Multilevel Model
- Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP)
- Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
- Kriging
- Health Impact Assessment (HIA)

## Quasi-Poisson Time Series (QPTS)

- **GLM Components**: Distribution for modeling \(Y_i\), a linear predictor \(\eta = X\beta\), and a link function \(g\) such that \(E[Y] = \mu = g^{-1}(\eta)\).
- **QPTS Definition**:
  - \(Y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)\)
  - \(\eta_i = X_i \beta\)
  - \(g(\lambda_i) = \log(\lambda_i) = \eta_i\), thus \(\lambda_i = g^{-1}(\eta_i) = \exp(\eta_i)\)
- **Overdispersion**:
  - \(Var(Y_i) = \theta \lambda_i\)
  - If \(\theta = 1\), data conforms to Poisson assumption. If \(\theta > 1\), data is overdispersed. If \(\theta < 1\), data is underdispersed.

## Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model (DLNM)

- **Purpose**: Assess how an exposure affects outcomes over time, capturing delayed impacts.
- **Model**:
  - \(log(E[Y_i]) = \alpha + s(temp_i, \eta) + \sum_{p=1}^{P} h_p(z_{p,i}, \gamma_p)\)
  - Where \(E[Y_i]\) is the expected daily death count on day \(i\), \(s(temp_i, \eta)\) is the distributed lag non-linear function for temperature, and \(h_p(z_{p,i}, \gamma_p)\) represents the contribution of the \(p\)-th confounder.

# Joint Effect of Heat and Air Pollution on Mortality (2023; Stafoggia et al.)

## Findings

- **Scope**: Analyzed data from 620 cities in 36 countries.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Increased Mortality with Combined Exposure: Both high temperatures and air pollution independently increase mortality rates, but their combined effect is even more significant.
  - Temperature increase (75th to 99th percentile) leads to 8.9% rise in mortality.
