abstract = {The ability of households and individuals to access food (one of the key aspects of 'food security') is an important welfare dimension that poses important challenges for objective measurement. This paper describes the Rasch model-based procedures developed to define the eight-item Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) as a contribution towards the establishment of an indicator for global monitoring of food insecurity. Experiential food insecurity survey data, collected by FAO from nationally representative samples of the adult population, once every year in 2014, 2015 and 2016 from 153 countries or territories, are used to develop methods to estimate cross-country comparable prevalence rates of moderate and severe food insecurity. A Rasch model-based scale was estimated separately for each country and data were assessed for consistency with model assumptions. To ensure cross-country comparability, a procedure based on the median normalized severities of each of the eight FIES items was used to define a global reference scale, against which measures obtained in each country can be separately calibrated. Calibration is obtained by equating the mean and standard deviation of the severity parameters of the items that appear to be common between the national and the reference scale, and thus used as anchoring points for the metric. Data showed sufficient consistency with the Rasch model assumptions to produce reliable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity in each country. Calibration was possible using 4 or more items as anchoring points in 151 of 153 (98.7%) of the cases, and 6 or more items in the vast majority of them (121 cases). Concurrent validation of the estimates of prevalence of food insecurity at national level was obtained by comparing the FIES-based indicator with other established indicators of social (under) development. National prevalence rates of moderate-or-severe food insecurity obtained by FAO correlate well with the prevalence of undernourishment and with several widely used indicators of national income, health, and well-being. The proposed calibration method can be applied to other existing experience-based food security scales that use similar items, thus affording the possibility to use data collected with those instruments to produce internationally comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity. Pending broader adoption of the FIES or compatible experience-based food security scales worldwide, countries could choose to use the 2014–2016 results obtained using the data collected by FAO as the baseline to monitor progress towards Target 2.1 of the recently established 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.}

@ARTICLE{Armstrong2006-mv,
  title    = "Models for the relationship between ambient temperature and daily
              mortality",
  author   = "Armstrong, Ben",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ambient temperature is an important determinant of
              daily mortality that is of interest both in its own right and as
              a confounder of other determinants investigated using time-series
              regressions, in particular, air pollution. The
              temperature-mortality relationship is often found to be
              substantially nonlinear and to persist (but change shape) with
              increasing lag. We review and extend models for such nonlinear
              multilag forms. DEVELOPMENT: Popular models for mortality by
              temperature at given lag include polynomial and natural cubic
              spline curves, and the simple but more easily interpreted linear
              thresholds model, comprising linear relationships for
              temperatures below and above thresholds and a flat middle
              section. Most published analyses that have allowed the
              relationship to persist over multiple lags have done so by
              assuming that spline or threshold models apply to mean
              temperature in several lag strata (e.g., lags 0-1, 2-6, and
              7-13). However, more flexible models are possible, and a modeling
              framework using products of basis functions (``cross-basis''
              functions) suggests a wide range, some used previously and some
              new. These allow for stepped or smooth changes in the model
              coefficients as lags increase. Applying a range of models to data
              from London suggest evidence for relationships up to at least 2
              weeks' lag, with smooth models fitting best but lag-stratified
              threshold models allowing the most direct interpretation.
              CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of multilag nonlinear
              temperature-mortality relationships can be modeled. More
              awareness of options should improve investigation of these
              relationships and help control for confounding by them.",

abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2°C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).}
