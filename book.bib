              mortality",
  author   = "Armstrong, Ben",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ambient temperature is an important determinant of
              daily mortality that is of interest both in its own right and as
              a confounder of other determinants investigated using time-series
              regressions, in particular, air pollution. The
              temperature-mortality relationship is often found to be
              substantially nonlinear and to persist (but change shape) with
              increasing lag. We review and extend models for such nonlinear
              multilag forms. DEVELOPMENT: Popular models for mortality by
              temperature at given lag include polynomial and natural cubic
              spline curves, and the simple but more easily interpreted linear
              thresholds model, comprising linear relationships for
              temperatures below and above thresholds and a flat middle
              section. Most published analyses that have allowed the
              relationship to persist over multiple lags have done so by
              assuming that spline or threshold models apply to mean
              temperature in several lag strata (e.g., lags 0-1, 2-6, and
              7-13). However, more flexible models are possible, and a modeling
              framework using products of basis functions (``cross-basis''
              functions) suggests a wide range, some used previously and some
              new. These allow for stepped or smooth changes in the model
              coefficients as lags increase. Applying a range of models to data
              from London suggest evidence for relationships up to at least 2
              weeks' lag, with smooth models fitting best but lag-stratified
              threshold models allowing the most direct interpretation.
              CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of multilag nonlinear
              temperature-mortality relationships can be modeled. More
              awareness of options should improve investigation of these
              relationships and help control for confounding by them.",

abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2°C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).}
