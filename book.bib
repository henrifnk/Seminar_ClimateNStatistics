abstract = {The ability of households and individuals to access food (one of the key aspects of 'food security') is an important welfare dimension that poses important challenges for objective measurement. This paper describes the Rasch model-based procedures developed to define the eight-item Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) as a contribution towards the establishment of an indicator for global monitoring of food insecurity. Experiential food insecurity survey data, collected by FAO from nationally representative samples of the adult population, once every year in 2014, 2015 and 2016 from 153 countries or territories, are used to develop methods to estimate cross-country comparable prevalence rates of moderate and severe food insecurity. A Rasch model-based scale was estimated separately for each country and data were assessed for consistency with model assumptions. To ensure cross-country comparability, a procedure based on the median normalized severities of each of the eight FIES items was used to define a global reference scale, against which measures obtained in each country can be separately calibrated. Calibration is obtained by equating the mean and standard deviation of the severity parameters of the items that appear to be common between the national and the reference scale, and thus used as anchoring points for the metric. Data showed sufficient consistency with the Rasch model assumptions to produce reliable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity in each country. Calibration was possible using 4 or more items as anchoring points in 151 of 153 (98.7%) of the cases, and 6 or more items in the vast majority of them (121 cases). Concurrent validation of the estimates of prevalence of food insecurity at national level was obtained by comparing the FIES-based indicator with other established indicators of social (under) development. National prevalence rates of moderate-or-severe food insecurity obtained by FAO correlate well with the prevalence of undernourishment and with several widely used indicators of national income, health, and well-being. The proposed calibration method can be applied to other existing experience-based food security scales that use similar items, thus affording the possibility to use data collected with those instruments to produce internationally comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity. Pending broader adoption of the FIES or compatible experience-based food security scales worldwide, countries could choose to use the 2014–2016 results obtained using the data collected by FAO as the baseline to monitor progress towards Target 2.1 of the recently established 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.}

  title    = "Models for the relationship between ambient temperature and daily
              mortality",
  author   = "Armstrong, Ben",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Ambient temperature is an important determinant of
              daily mortality that is of interest both in its own right and as
              a confounder of other determinants investigated using time-series
              regressions, in particular, air pollution. The
              temperature-mortality relationship is often found to be
              substantially nonlinear and to persist (but change shape) with
              increasing lag. We review and extend models for such nonlinear
              multilag forms. DEVELOPMENT: Popular models for mortality by
              temperature at given lag include polynomial and natural cubic
              spline curves, and the simple but more easily interpreted linear
              thresholds model, comprising linear relationships for
              temperatures below and above thresholds and a flat middle
              section. Most published analyses that have allowed the
              relationship to persist over multiple lags have done so by
              assuming that spline or threshold models apply to mean
              temperature in several lag strata (e.g., lags 0-1, 2-6, and
              7-13). However, more flexible models are possible, and a modeling
              framework using products of basis functions (``cross-basis''
              functions) suggests a wide range, some used previously and some
              new. These allow for stepped or smooth changes in the model
              coefficients as lags increase. Applying a range of models to data
              from London suggest evidence for relationships up to at least 2
              weeks' lag, with smooth models fitting best but lag-stratified
              threshold models allowing the most direct interpretation.
              CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of multilag nonlinear
              temperature-mortality relationships can be modeled. More
              awareness of options should improve investigation of these
              relationships and help control for confounding by them.",

abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2°C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).}

I study India, where one fifth of global suicides occur and suicide rates have doubled since 1980. Using nationally comprehensive panel data over 47 y, I demonstrate that fluctuations in climate, particularly temperature, significantly influence suicide rates. For temperatures above 20 {$^\circ$}C, a 1 {$^\circ$}C increase in a single day's temperature causes {$\sim$}70 suicides, on average. This effect occurs only during India's agricultural growing season, when heat also lowers crop yields. I find no evidence that acclimatization, rising incomes, or other unobserved drivers of adaptation are occurring. I estimate that warming over the last 30 y is responsible for 59,300 suicides in India, accounting for 6.8\% of the total upward trend. These results deliver large-scale quantitative evidence linking climate and agricultural income to self-harm in a developing country.},

This scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the World Health Organisation's (WHO) five global research priorities for protecting human health from climate change. We conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in high-income countries (n = 87), and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities---assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (n = 8); mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support (n = 3); and cost estimations (n = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.},

The combined incidence of PTSD was estimated using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation method. Subgroup analyses were conducted on different trauma intensities and different time points after a flood. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of research quality. Fourteen articles were included in this meta-analysis, including a total of 40 600 flood victims; 3862 victims were diagnosed with PTSD. The combined incidence of PTSD was 15.74\%. The subgroup analyses showed that the incidence of PTSD in victims who experienced severe and moderate flood intensity was higher than that in victims who experienced mild flood intensity. The incidence of PTSD was lower at 6 or more months after a flood (11.45\%) than within 6 months (16.01\%) of a flood. In conclusion, the incidence of PTSD among floods of different trauma intensities was statistically significant. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2015;9:329-333)},

The consequences of climate change on exposed biological subjects, as well as on vulnerable societies, are a concern for the entire scientific community. Rising temperatures, heat waves, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, fires, loss of forest, and glaciers, along with disappearance of rivers and desertification, can directly and indirectly cause human pathologies that are physical and mental. However, there is a clear lack in psychiatric studies on mental disorders linked to climate change.{$<$}/p{$><$}/sec{$><$}sec{$><$}title{$>$}Methods{$<$}/title{$><$}p{$>$}Literature available on PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library until end of June 2019 were reviewed. The total number of articles and association reports was 445. From these, 163 were selected. We looked for the association between classical psychiatric disorders such as anxiety schizophrenia, mood disorder and depression, suicide, aggressive behaviors, despair for the loss of usual landscape, and phenomena related to climate change and extreme weather. Review of literature was then divided into specific areas: the course of change in mental health, temperature, water, air pollution, drought, as well as the exposure of certain groups and critical psychological adaptations.{$<$}/p{$><$}/sec{$><$}sec{$><$}title{$>$}Results{$<$}/title{$><$}p{$>$}Climate change has an impact on a large part of the population, in different geographical areas and with different types of threats to public health. However, the delay in studies on climate change and mental health consequences is an important aspect. Lack of literature is perhaps due to the complexity and novelty of this issue. It has been shown that climate change acts on mental health with different timing. The phenomenology of the effects of climate change differs greatly---some mental disorders are common and others more specific in relation to atypical climatic conditions. Moreover, climate change also affects different population groups who are directly exposed and more vulnerable in their geographical conditions, as well as a lack of access to resources, information, and protection. Perhaps it is also worth underlining that in some papers the connection between climatic events and mental disorders was described through the introduction of new terms, coined only recently: ecoanxiety, ecoguilt, ecopsychology, ecological grief, solastalgia, biospheric concern, etc.{$<$}/p{$><$}/sec{$><$}sec{$><$}title{$>$}Conclusions{$<$}/title{$><$}p{$>$}The effects of climate change can be direct or indirect, short-term or long-term.

Overall, we observed evidence for two key findings that are salient for residents of urban environments in the context of multiple disasters.

  abstract = {While the economic and environmental impacts of drought have been widely studied, there are few large-scale studies that have examined the impact of drought on mental health. This paper is one of the first to provide estimates of the impact of drought on mental health using a large-scale representative survey. The analysis is based upon a 2007 survey of 8,000 people living in rural and regional areas of Australia. At the time the survey was conducted a substantial part of the Australian continent was experiencing severe drought. The impacts of drought are estimated using regression models which allow for the effects of demographic and geographic variables to be held constant. A novel feature of this paper is that the impact of drought on the mental health is estimated separately for a range of people in rural areas---including non-farmers as well as farmers and farm workers. The paper finds that drought does have negative mental health impacts and that those who are most impacted upon are farmers and farm workers. There do not appear to be substantial flow-on effects of drought on the mental health of those employed outside of agriculture. There is evidence that the more severe the agricultural impact of drought the greater the impact on mental health. Farmers who reported that the drought had eliminated or reduced their farm's productivity to the lowest point ever had significantly higher rates of mental health problems and lower mental health wellbeing scores than those who did not report they were in drought or reported that the drought had little or no effect. The findings are notable given that recent climate change scenarios suggest that the frequency and severity of drought will increase in many countries.},

  abstract = {Extreme climatic events are likely to become more frequent owing to global warming. This may put additional stress on critical infrastructures with typically long life spans. However, little is known about the risks of multiple climate extremes on critical infrastructures at regional to continental scales. Here we show how single- and multi-hazard damage to energy, transport, industrial, and social critical infrastructures in Europe are likely to develop until the year 2100 under the influence of climate change. We combine a set of high-resolution climate hazard projections, a detailed representation of physical assets in various sectors and their sensitivity to the hazards, and more than 1100 records of losses from climate extremes in a prognostic modelling framework. We find that damages could triple by the 2020s, multiply six-fold by mid-century, and amount to more than 10 times present damage of {\texteuro}3.4 billion per year by the end of the century due only to climate change. Damage from heatwaves, droughts in southern Europe, and coastal floods shows the most dramatic rise, but the risks of inland flooding, windstorms, and forest fires will also increase in Europe, with varying degrees of change across regions. Economic losses are highest for the industry, transport, and energy sectors. Future losses will not be incurred equally across Europe. Southern and south-eastern European countries will be most affected and, as a result, will probably require higher costs of adaptation. The findings of this study could aid in prioritizing regional investments to address the unequal burden of impacts and differences in adaptation capacities across Europe.},

  abstract = {There is concern in Australia that droughts substantially increase the incidence of suicide in rural populations, particularly among male farmers and their families. We investigated this possibility for the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia between 1970 and 2007, analyzing data on suicides with a previously established climatic drought index. Using a generalized additive model that controlled for season, region, and long-term suicide trends, we found an increased relative risk of suicide of 15\% (95\% confidence interval, 8\%--22\%) for rural males aged 30--49 y when the drought index rose from the first quartile to the third quartile. In contrast, the risk of suicide for rural females aged {$>$}30 y declined with increased values of the drought index. We also observed an increased risk of suicide in spring and early summer. In addition there was a smaller association during unusually warm months at any time of year. The spring suicide increase is well documented in nontropical locations, although its cause is unknown. The possible increased risk of suicide during drought in rural Australia warrants public health focus and concern, as does the annual, predictable increase seen each spring and early summer. Suicide is a complex phenomenon with many interacting social, environmental, and biological causal factors. The relationship between drought and suicide is best understood using a holistic framework. Climate change projections suggest increased frequency and severity of droughts in NSW, accompanied and exacerbated by rising temperatures. Elucidating the relationships between drought and mental health will help facilitate adaptation to climate change.},

  abstract = {Background               As the climate and environmental crises unfold, eco-anxiety, defined as anxiety about the crises' devastating consequences for life on earth, affects mental health worldwide. Despite its importance, research on eco-anxiety is currently limited by a lack of validated assessment instruments available in different languages. Recently, Hogg and colleagues proposed a multidimensional approach to assess eco-anxiety. Here, we aim to translate the original English Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale (HEAS) into German and to assess its reliability and validity in a German sample.                                         Methods               Following the TRAPD (translation, review, adjudication, pre-test, documentation) approach, we translated the original English scale into German. In total, 486 participants completed the German HEAS. We used Bayesian confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess whether the four-factorial model of the original English version could be replicated in the German sample. Furthermore, associations with a variety of emotional reactions towards the climate crisis, general depression, anxiety, and stress were investigated.                                         Results               The German HEAS was internally consistent (Cronbach's alphas 0.71--0.86) and the Bayesian CFA showed that model fit was best for the four-factorial model, comparable to the factorial structure of the original English scale (affective symptoms, rumination, behavioral symptoms, anxiety about personal impact). Weak to moderate associations were found with negative emotional reactions towards the climate crisis and with general depression, anxiety, and stress.                                         Discussion               Our results support the original four-factorial model of the scale and indicate that the German HEAS is a reliable and valid scale to assess eco-anxiety in German speaking populations.},

We used a multi-study mixed-methods design to explore eco-anxiety in Australia and New Zealand, validating a new eco-anxiety scale. In Study One, we developed and tested a 7-item eco-anxiety scale (n~=~334), finding that this captured some, but not all, experiences of eco-anxiety. We found that people were anxious about a range of environmental conditions and their personal negative impact on the planet. Notably, people's anxiety about different environmental conditions (e.g., climate change, environmental degradation, pollution) were interconnected, lending support for the existence of eco-anxiety (a broader construct that encompasses climate change anxiety). These results informed further scale development in Study Two. Exploratory (n~=~365) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (n~=~370) supported a final 13-item scale that captured four dimensions of eco-anxiety: affective symptoms, rumination, behavioural symptoms, and anxiety about one's negative impact on the planet, which were each distinct from stress, anxiety and depression. A further longitudinal sample (n~=~189) established the stability of these factors across time. Findings support eco-anxiety as a quantifiable psychological experience, reliably measured using our 13-item eco-anxiety scale, and differentiated from mental health outcomes.},

This performance was consistent with findings reported in prior CAS validation studies, leading some researchers to propose alternative CAS models. We contributed to the literature by testing all alternative CAS models using our Australian data. Dimensions of climate anxiety and eco-anxiety were closely related, and showed similar patterns of associations with risk perceptions and the ways people engage with environmental news.

  abstract = {Introduction Assessing the psychological impact of climate change is of crucial importance as it is widely recognized that human mental health is negatively affected by changing weather patterns. Worry about climate change is commonly used as a measure of risk perception, and includes concepts such as concern, perceived seriousness, and perceived risk. In order to better evaluate the levels of climate change worry, Alan E. Stewart developed the Climate Change Worry Scale (CCWS). Methods The aim of the present study was to validate Stewart's CCWS in Italy. To this purpose, CCWS was translated into Italian and its psychometric properties were tested on a sample of 130 Italian adults who were required to complete the CCWS, as well as other standards of measurement, such as the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), Pro-Environmental Behaviours Scale (PEBS) and Climate Change Anxiety Scale (CCAS). Patients were retested after three months. In this study, Stewart's original single-factor scale was used. Additionally, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and discriminant validity were specifically analysed. Results Factor structure of CCWS was investigated, and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) showed a good fit for the single-factor model. Climate Change Worry Scale items exhibited excellent internal consistency. Test-retest reliability at a three-month evaluation proved to be good. Climate change worry was associated with concern, climate change anxiety, pro-environmental behaviors and political orientation. Conclusions The Italian version of the Climate Change Worry Scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess climate change worry in the general population.},

  abstract = {A representative sample of 815 pre-hurricane residents of the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina was interviewed 5--8 months after the hurricane and again 1 year later as the Hurricane Katrina Community Advisory Group (CAG). The follow-up survey was carried out to study patterns-correlates of recovery from hurricane-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), broader anxiety-mood disorders and suicidality. The Trauma Screening Questionnaire screening scale of PTSD and the K6 screening scale of anxiety-mood disorders were used to generate DSM-IV prevalence estimates. Contrary to results in other disaster studies, where post-disaster mental disorder typically decreases with time, prevalence increased significantly in the CAG for PTSD (20.9 vs 14.9\% at baseline), serious mental illness (SMI; 14.0 vs 10.9\%), suicidal ideation (6.4 vs 2.8\%) and suicide plans (2.5 vs 1.0\%). The increases in PTSD-SMI were confined to respondents not from the New Orleans Metropolitan Area, while the increases in suicidal ideation-plans occurred both in the New Orleans sub-sample and in the remainder of the sample. Unresolved hurricane-related stresses accounted for large proportions of the inter-temporal increases in SMI (89.2\%), PTSD (31.9\%) and suicidality (61.6\%). Differential hurricane-related stress did not explain the significantly higher increases among respondents from areas other than New Orleans, though, as this stress was both higher initially and decreased less among respondents from the New Orleans Metropolitan Area than from other areas affected by the hurricane. Outcomes were only weakly related to socio-demographic variables, meaning that high prevalence of hurricane-related mental illness remains widely distributed in the population nearly 2 years after the hurricane.},

  abstract = {Environment-related anxiety is becoming an important and increasingly widespread emotional response to ecological crises. This phenomenon presents new challenges in terms of public health as it can lead to cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments in daily life. These impairments are measured by the Climate change Anxiety Scale (CAS, Clayton \& Karazsia, 2020), the only tool validated in French that assesses climate anxiety. However, eco-anxiety, which encompasses more than climate anxiety, may affect an individual's inner life without causing pathological impairments in their daily life. Consequently, new tools for assessing eco-anxiety at a non-pathological level in French-speaking populations are required. The goal of this study was to translate and validate the Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale (HEAS, Hogg et al., 2021) in French (HEAS-FR) and analyze its psychometric properties based on responses from 275 French-speaking adults. The HEAS is a self-report measure specifically designed to assess psychological responses to climate change and ecological issues. The confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the four-factor structure of the original English version. Cronbach's alphas indicated fair-to-good internal consistency for all four HEAS-FR subscales. Its convergent validity was established by examining correlations with questionnaires assessing related constructs, including climate change anxiety, anxiety, stress, depression, and environmental identity. The results revealed globally moderate-to-strong positive correlations between the HEAS-FR subscales and all questionnaires, indicating good convergent validity. Therefore, HEAS-FR was found to be suitable for assessing the four dimensions of eco-anxiety proposed by Hogg et al. (2021) in French-speaking populations.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The empirical assessment of the health outcomes associated with migration caused by climate change is still unclear. However, health outcomes in the early stages are expected to be similar to the health outcomes associated with refugees. The objective of the present study was a systematic review of the health effects of migration caused by climate change. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were used to identify papers published that evaluated the health effects of migration caused by climate change. The search, article selection, and data extraction were carried out by two researchers independently. All English-language articles on the health effects of migration caused by climate change were included in this study. RESULTS: An analysis of the complex ways in which climate change influences populations can be facilitated using a three-class classification: compulsory displacement, resettlement planning, and migration. Subsequent to climate changes, other changes, and environmental deficiencies, compulsory displacement may occur in case of inadequacy of compatibility responses. A part of migration-related health outcomes caused by climate change is from displacement from rural to urban areas, especially in developing countries. There is significant documentation on health and livelihood inequalities between migrant groups and host populations in developed countries. CONCLUSION: If climate change continues in its current direction, it is likely that the number of refugees and crises will increase in the coming decades. Although the domain and the extent of health hazards caused by the displacement of the population associated with climate change cannot be clearly predicted, by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, along with social and environmental adaptation strategies, migration caused by climate change, health risks and its relevant crises can be greatly reduced.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extensive flooding occurred during the winter of 2013-14 in England. Previous studies have shown that flooding affects mental health. Using data from the 2013-14 Public Health England National Study of Flooding and Health, we compared the prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder between participants displaced by flooding and those flooded, but not displaced, 1 year after flooding. METHODS: In this multivariable ordinal regression analysis, we collected data from a cross-sectional survey collected 1 year after the flooding event from flood-affected postcodes in five counties in England. The analysis was restricted to individuals whose homes were flooded (n=622) to analyse displacement due to flooding. The primary outcome measures were depression (measured by the PHQ-2 depression scale) and anxiety (measured by the two-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder [GAD]-2 anxiety scale), and post-traumatic stress disorder (measured by the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist [PCL]-6 scale). We adjusted analyses for recorded potential confounders. We also analysed duration of displacement and amount of warning received. FINDINGS: People who were displaced from their homes were significantly more likely to have higher scores on each scale; odds ratio (OR) for depression 1{$\cdot$}95 (95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}30-2{$\cdot$}93), for anxiety 1{$\cdot$}66 (1{$\cdot$}12-2{$\cdot$}46), and for post-traumatic stress disorder 1{$\cdot$}70 (1{$\cdot$}17-2{$\cdot$}48) than people who were not displaced. The increased risk of depression was significant even after adjustment for severity of flooding. Scores for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were higher in people who were displaced and reported receiving no warning than those who had received a warning more than 12 h in advance of flooding (p=0{$\cdot$}04 for depression, p=0{$\cdot$}01 for post-traumatic stress disorder), although the difference in anxiety scores was not significant. INTERPRETATION: Displacement after flooding was associated with higher reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder 1 year after flooding. The amount of warning received showed evidence of being protective against symptoms of the three mental illnesses studied, and the severity of flooding might be the reason for some, but not all, of the differences between the groups.

  abstract = {Wellbeing falters without sound mental health. Scholars have recently indicated that the impacts of climate change are likely to undermine mental health through a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms. Using daily meteorological data coupled with information from nearly 2 million randomly sampled US residents across a decade of data collection, we find that experience with hotter temperatures and added precipitation each worsen mental health, that multiyear warming associates with an increased prevalence of mental health issues, and that exposure to tropical cyclones, likely to increase in frequency and intensity in the future, is linked to worsened mental health. These results provide added large-scale evidence to the growing literature linking climate change and mental health., Sound mental health---a critical facet of human wellbeing---has the potential to be undermined by climate change. Few large-scale studies have empirically examined this hypothesis. Here, we show that short-term exposure to more extreme weather, multiyear warming, and tropical cyclone exposure each associate with worsened mental health. To do so, we couple meteorological and climatic data with reported mental health difficulties drawn from nearly 2 million randomly sampled US residents between 2002 and 2012. We find that shifting from monthly temperatures between 25 {$^\circ$}C and 30 {$^\circ$}C to {$>$}30 {$^\circ$}C increases the probability of mental health difficulties by 0.5\% points, that 1{$^\circ$}C of 5-year warming associates with a 2\% point increase in the prevalence of mental health issues, and that exposure to Hurricane Katrina associates with a 4\% point increase in this metric. Our analyses provide added quantitative support for the conclusion that environmental stressors produced by climate change pose threats to human mental health.},

  abstract = {The mental health impact of drought is poorly quantified and no previous research has demonstrated a relationship between distress and explicit environmentally based measures of drought. With continuing climate change, it is important to understand what drought is and how it may affect the mental health. We quantified drought in terms of duration and intensity of relative dryness and identified drought characteristics associated with poor mental health to evaluate any vulnerability in rural and urban communities. Our methods involved analysis of 100-year longitudinal records of monthly rainfall linked to one wave (2007--2008) of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. Cluster analysis was used to characterise different patterns of dryness and linear regression analysis was used to examine associations with participant distress, as well as the moderating role of rural locality. The results showed that, during a seven-year period of major and widespread drought, one pattern of relative dryness (extreme cumulative number of months in drought culminating in a recent period of dryness lasting a year or more) was associated with increased distress for rural but not urban dwellers. The increase in distress was estimated to be 6.22\%, based on 95\% confidence intervals. Thus, we show that it is possible to quantitatively identify an association between patterns of drought and distress.},

  abstract = {Eco-anxiety is increasingly recognized as a shared experience by many people internationally, encompassing fear of environmental catastrophe and anxiety about ecological crises. Despite its importance in the context of the changing climate, measures for this construct are still being developed in languages other than English. To contribute to global eco-anxiety research, we translated the Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale (HEAS) into Spanish, creating the HEAS-SP. We validated this measure in samples from both Argentina (n = 990) and Spain (n = 548), performing measurement invariance and confirmatory factor analyses. Internal consistency of the scale and score stability over time were investigated through reliability analyses. Differences in eco-anxiety across sociodemographic variables were explored through Student's t-tests and Pearson's r tests. The four-factor model of the HEAS-SP comprising affective and behavioural symptoms, rumination, and anxiety about personal impact demonstrated excellent model fit. We found good internal consistency for each subscale, and established measurement invariance between Spanish and Argentine samples, as well as across genders and participants' age. Spanish participants reported higher scores on the affective symptoms and personal impact anxiety factors compared to the Argentinian sample. Also, men reported lower levels than women on the subscales of affective symptoms, rumination, and personal impact anxiety. It was found that the relationship between both age and personal impact anxiety and age and affective symptoms varies significantly depending on the gender of the individuals. Younger participants tended to report higher scores on most dimensions of eco-anxiety. These findings enhance the global initiative to investigate, explore and therefore comprehend eco-anxiety by introducing the first valid and reliable Spanish-language version of this psychometric instrument for its use within Spanish and Argentinian populations. This study augments the body of evidence supporting the robust psychometric properties of the HEAS, as demonstrated in prior validations for Australian, Turkish, Portuguese, German, French, and Italian populations.},

  abstract = {Background Worsening environmental conditions may amplify people's emotional responses to an environmental crisis (eco-anxiety). In Portugal, young people seem to be especially concerned about climate change. However, this phenomenon needs to be interpreted using accurate instruments. Thus, this study aimed to validate the Portuguese version of the Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale (HEAS) in young adults and examine the associations among eco-anxiety, sociodemographic characteristics, and pro-environmental behaviours. Methods A survey was administered to 623 Portuguese university students aged between 18 and 25 years. The survey included our Portuguese translation of the HEAS (obtained through a back-translation and pretesting process), a sociodemographic assessment, and questions related to pro-environmental behaviours. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess the construct validity of the Portuguese version of the HEAS, and global fit indices were used to assess whether the original four-dimensional structure of the scale was reproduced. The reliability of the Portuguese version of the HEAS was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha and the intraclass correlation coefficient. Measurement invariance examined sex differences in scale interpretation. Linear regressions were used to detect whether sociodemographic variables predict eco-anxiety and whether eco-anxiety predicts pro-environmental behaviours. Results The factorial structure of the original scale was replicated in the Portuguese version of the HEAS, showing good internal consistency, reliability over time and strict invariance between men and women. A higher paternal education level predicted greater eco-anxiety in children. Two dimensions of eco-anxiety---namely, rumination and anxiety about personal impacts on the environment---predicted higher engagement in pro-environmental behaviours. Conclusions The translated scale is an appropriate tool to measure eco-anxiety in the Portuguese context and should be used to collect evidence to drive environmental and health policies. An individual's education level should be considered a determinant of their emotional response to environmental conditions. Importantly, eco-anxiety can act as a protective emotional response to preserving the planet.

  abstract = {Background There is evidence for a seasonal pattern of suicides with peaks in spring and early summer; however, only a limited number of studies has investigated whether daily changes in meteorological variables may trigger suicides. Methods Daily fatal suicide (N~=~10,595) and meteorological data were available for four Bavarian cities and ten counties (Germany) for 1990--2006. City/county-specific immediate, delayed and cumulative effects of air temperature, sunshine duration, and cloud cover on suicides were analyzed using a time-stratified case-crossover approach; city/county-specific effects were then combined using random effects meta-analysis. Potential effect modifiers were specific weather conditions, personal or regional characteristics, and season. Results A 5~{$^\circ$}C increase in air temperature on the day before a suicide compared to the control days was associated with a 5.7\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.6; 11.0) higher suicide risk. Further, the suicide risk was 6.5\% (95\% CI: 0.2; 13.3) higher on days with low/medium cloud cover (0--6 oktas) compared to days with high cloud cover (7--8 oktas). While daily changes in temperature were not associated with suicides in spring, we found a higher suicide risk in summer, autumn, and winter in association with temperature increases. The effects of cloud cover were strongest in summer and autumn and on days with temperature above the median ({$>$}8.8~{$^\circ$}C). Sunshine duration was not associated with suicides. Conclusion We found a higher risk for suicides in association with short-term increases in air temperature on the day before the event compared to the control days and on days with low to medium cloud cover. This may highlight times when people are more likely to commit suicide.},

  abstract = {Background: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), produces influential, data-driven estimates of the burden of disease and premature death due to major risk factors. Expanded quantification of disease due to environmental health (EH) risk factors, including climate change, will enhance accuracy of GBD estimates, which will contribute to developing cost-effective policies that promote prevention and achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Objectives: We review key aspects of the GBD for the EH community and introduce the Global Burden of Disease--Pollution and Health Initiative (GBD-PHI), which aims to work with IHME and the GBD study to improve estimates of disease burden attributable to EH risk factors and to develop an innovative approach to estimating climate-related disease burden---both current and projected. Methods: We discuss strategies for improving GBD quantification of specific EH risk factors, including air pollution, lead, and climate change. We highlight key methodological challenges, including new EH risk factors, notably evidence rating and global exposure assessment. Discussion: A number of issues present challenges to the scope and accuracy of current GBD estimates for EH risk factors. For air pollution, minimal data exist on the exposure--risk relationships associated with high levels of pollution; epidemiological studies in high pollution regions should be a research priority. For lead, the GBD's current methods do not fully account for lead's impact on neurodevelopment; innovative methods to account for subclinical effects are needed. Decisions on inclusion of additional EH risk--outcome pairs need to be guided by findings of systematic reviews, the size of exposed populations, feasibility of global exposure estimates, and predicted trends in exposures and diseases. Neurotoxicants, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and climate-related factors should be high priorities for incorporation into upcoming iterations of the GBD study. Enhancing the scope and methods will improve the GBD's estimates and better guide prevention policy. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5496},

Such worry is one of several possible psychological responses (e.g., fear, anxiety, depression, and trauma) to climate change. Within this article, the psychometric development of the ten-item Climate Change Worry Scale (CCWS) is detailed in three studies. The scale was developed to assess proximal worry about climate change rather than social or global impacts. Study 1 provided evidence that the CCWS items were internally consistent, constituted a single factor, and that the facture structure of the items was invariant for men and women. The results from Study 1 also indicated a good fit with a Rasch model of the items. Study 2 affirmed the internal consistency of the CCWS items and indicated that peoples' responses to the measure were temporally stable over a two-week test--retest interval (r = 0.91). Study 3 provided support for the convergent and divergent validity of the CCWS through its pattern of correlations with several established clinical and weather-related measures. The limitations of the studies and the possible uses of the CCWS were discussed. The current work represents a starting point.},

  abstract = {Objective: This research aimed to adapt the Eco-Anxiety Scale to Turkish and conduct a validity and reliability study. Methods: The sample of this study consists of 698 individuals living in Turkey and participating in the study on a voluntary basis. The data of the research was collected online using the ``Personal Information Form'' and the ``Eco-Anxiety Scale.'' In line with the data obtained, Cronbach's alpha value was examined to test the internal consistency of the scale, and exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used for construct validity. Results: The original form of the Eco-Anxiety Scale is a 4-point Likert type consisting of 13 items and 4 dimensions, and it preserves its original structure in this study. Cronbach's alpha value for the total scale was 0.91; it was 0.83 for the ``affective symptoms,'' 0.86 for the ``behavioral symptoms,'' 0.84 for the ``rumination,'' and 0.84 for the ``anxiety about personal impact.'' According to the results of the confirmatory factor analysis applied to test the construct validity (CFI=0.97, NFI=0.96, RSMEA=0.06, and GFI=0.96), the goodness of fit of the 4-factor structure was found to be at an acceptable level and satisfactory. The correlation results in this model regarding the relationship of the subscales with each other show that all of the subscales are positively and significantly correlated with each other (P {$<$} .01). Conclusion: In this study, it was determined that the Eco-Anxiety Scale, which was adapted into Turkish, is a valid and reliable measurement tool for measuring the eco-anxiety levels of individuals.

In particular, the implications of drought for mental health via pathways such as loss of livelihood, diminished social support, and rupture of place bonds have not been extensively studied, leaving a knowledge gap for practitioners and researchers alike. A systematic review of literature was performed to examine the mental health effects of drought. The systematic review results were synthesized to create a causal process diagram that illustrates the pathways linking drought effects to mental health outcomes. Eighty-two articles using a variety of methods in different contexts were gathered from the systematic review. The pathways in the causal process diagram with greatest support in the literature are those focusing on the economic and migratory effects of drought. The diagram highlights the complexity of the relationships between drought and mental health, including the multiple ways that factors can interact and lead to various outcomes. The systematic review and resulting causal process diagram can be used in both practice and theory, including prevention planning, public health programming, vulnerability and risk assessment, and research question guidance. The use of a causal process diagram provides a much needed avenue for integrating the findings of diverse research to further the understanding of the mental health implications of drought.},

Recently, Clayton and Karazsia measured climate anxiety as ``a more clinically significant `anxious' response to climate change'' (2020, p. 9). To gain a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon from an empirical psychological perspective, we translated the core of the Climate Anxiety Scale into German and assessed potential correlates in a large German-speaking quota sample (N\,=\,1011, stratified by age and gender). Overall, people reported low levels of climate anxiety. Climate anxiety correlated positively with general anxiety and depressiveness, avoidance of climate change in everyday life, frustration of basic psychological needs, pro-environmental behavioral intentions, and policy support. It correlated negatively with different forms of climate denial and was unrelated to ideological beliefs. We were not able to replicate the two dimensions found in the original scale. Moreover, we argue that items appear to measure a general climate-related emotional impairment, rather than distinctly and comprehensively capturing climate anxiety. Thus, we encourage researchers to rework the scale and include an emotional factor in future research efforts.},
