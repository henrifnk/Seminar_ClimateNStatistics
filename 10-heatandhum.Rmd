## Introduction 

### Background 

Climate change is a broad and hot discussed topic as the number of heat-related deaths and the air-temperature break records.
Heat and Humidity are increased by the climate change as both gain higher values as the greenhouse gases rise. Physiologically one knows that heat and humidity are associated with human heat stress and negatively influences the human body.[1] Heat stress occurs when environmental conditions overwhelm body‘s cooling mechanism[2].
Besides that a broad range of epidemiological studies concluded that there is either no or just a weak effect of humidity on human heat stress and negative health outcomes. However, those studies all infer that a rise in air-temperature (heat) is associated with negative health outcomes. This two information lead to a controversial issue as physiologically it is known, that there is an effect of humidity on health outcomes. Heat in this chapter is used as synonym for high ambient temperature. 

### Humidity 

Humidity has several definitions and one need to be careful which of those is selected to answer a research question. Therefore it is essential to use an appropriate measure for humidity. Baldwin et al. (2023) describe the four following categories to distinguish between different humidity variables \
1. Simple relative variables including Relative Humidity (RH), Dew-point depression (DPD) and Saturation deficit \
2. Mass-based variables including Specific humidity, absolute humidity, dew point temperature, vapor pressure and mixing ratio \
3. Combined metrics such as the Heat index, Humidex, Wet-bulb-temperature, UTCI... \
4. Physiologic-based humidity indicators including Maximum evaporation, required evaporation, total evaporation \
Davis et al. did a review on commonly used humidity variables in epidemiological studies and found that 62% of all the studies they reviewed used RH as a humidity variable, whereas absolute humidity and specific humidity as humidity variables were used in 5.3% and 1.5% of the studies, respectively. Furthermore, the authors discussed how to use the different humidity variables and when it is appropriate to use which one.[3]


### Physiological background

Physiological it is known that heat and humidity should increase the risks for human health. Morbidity, Mortality, reduction in physical work capacity and further negative health outcomes are projected to increase further with the climate crisis. 
The human body has it's own cooling mechanism to control the body temperature. There are two ways of the body to respond to heat stress. One way is to redistribute the blood flow towards the skin (vasodilation) such that metabolically generated heat from inside the body reaches the skin surface and subsequently the environment. This way of cooling the body down requires an increased blood flow and increases the cardiac demand. People with heart conditions can lead to cardiovascular diseases.
The other way is to secret sweat onto the skin, which evaporates to the environment and heat from the body is removed. This cooling mechanisms are necessary for the human body to maintain the human core temperature.[4]
This mechanism to cool down the body lose their effectiveness with the increase of heat and humidity. With higher ambient humidity the proportion of sweat that evaporates from the skin to the environment, i.e the effectiveness of sweating decreases. Hence, sweating does not lead to heat loss anymore which leads to a continuation of the body temperature rise. The human body corresponds to that with further sweating, until enough sweat is generated to evaporate from the skin. But this increase of sweating can lead to heat stroke, dehydration or a sweat rate which exceeds the body's physical limits.[1]
Furthermore, there are several risk populations for whom the mechanisms of the body to cool itself down are already less efficient or even not working. For example people older than 65 has a diminished sweating ability or people with cardiovascular diseases can not pump more blood through the heart to transport the heat from inside the body to the skin. These are just two examples, but there are many more conditions which further influences the mechanisms to cool down the body.[4]
Summarizing one can say that if the body is not able to cool itself down anymore one suffer heat stress.
