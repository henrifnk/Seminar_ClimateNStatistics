## Introduction 

### Background 
Climate change is a broad and hot discussed topic as the number of heat-related deaths and the air-temperature break records. Extreme heat waves during summer seasons becoming permanent features and therefore heat-related deaths will increase[1]. More extreme weather events occur, environmental and health risk factors increase with the climate change. Especially Heat and Humidity are increased by the climate change as both gain higher values as the greenhouse gases rise. Physiologically one knows that heat and humidity are associated with human heat stress and negatively influences the human body.[2] Heat stress occurs when environmental conditions overwhelm body‘s cooling mechanism[3]. If the body's cooling mechanism is not able to cool down the core temperature this has a huge negative impact on the health of an individual. This heat stress can lead in extremes to death. It is known from a physiological perspective that the mechanism to cool down the core temperature are driven by the heat and humidity the body is surrounded by. Contrary to that, a broad range of epidemiological studies concluded that there is either no or just a weak effect of humidity on human heat stress and negative health outcomes. Those studies all infer that a rise in air-temperature (heat) is associated with negative health outcomes. This two-information lead to a controversial issue as physiologically it is known, that there is an effect of humidity on health outcomes, whereas in epidemiological studies they did not find an effect of humidity on health outcomes. Figure 1 describes this contradiction between physiological knowledge and epidemiological studies.
Heat in this chapter is used as synonym for high ambient temperature. 

### Epidemiological Studies 
Several epidemiological studies aimed to show an influence of humidity and heat on negative health outcomes such as death or cardiovascular diseases. Results of these studies are mixed regarding the association of humidity with negative health outcomes. A study in New York (US) found a positive association between high levels of relative humidity (RH) and cardio-respiratory hospitalizations. But this study is one of the only ones who found an association between humidity and a negative health outcome.

### Physiological background/Knowledge 
Physiological it is known that heat and humidity should increase the risks for human health. Morbidity, Mortality, reduction in physical work capacity and further negative health outcomes are projected to increase further with the climate crisis. [3]
The human body has its own cooling mechanism to control the body temperature. There are two ways of the body to respond to heat stress. One way is to redistribute the blood flow towards the skin (vasodilation) such that metabolically generated heat from inside the body reaches the skin surface and subsequently the environment. This way of cooling the body down requires an increased blood flow and increases the cardiac demand. People with heart conditions can lead to cardiovascular diseases.
The other way is to secret sweat onto the skin, which evaporates to the environment and heat from the body is removed. This cooling mechanisms are necessary for the human body to maintain the human core temperature. [1]
This mechanism to cool down the body lose their effectiveness with the increase of heat and humidity. With higher ambient humidity the proportion of sweat that evaporates from the skin to the environment, i.e the effectiveness of sweating decreases. Hence, sweating does not lead to heat loss anymore which leads to a continuation of the body temperature rise. The human body corresponds to that with further sweating, until enough sweat is generated to evaporate from the skin. But this increase of sweating can lead to heat stroke, dehydration or a sweat rate which exceeds the body's physical limits. [2]
Furthermore, there are several risk populations for whom the mechanisms of the body to cool itself down are already less efficient or even not working. For example, people older than 65 has a diminished sweating ability or people with cardiovascular diseases cannot pump more blood through the heart to transport the heat from inside the body to the skin. These are just two examples, but there are many more conditions which further influences the mechanisms to cool down the body. [1] Summarizing one can say that if the body is not able to cool itself down anymore one suffers heat stress. 
These physiological conclusions were not shown in most epidemiological studies. Several methodological aspects my lead to such results but also physiological explanations. Possible physiological reasons will be discussed in this section. First, heat-vulnerable people may have sweating impairments and therefore a reduced sweating capacity. Especially with aging the sweating response decreases and above the age of 60 years, thermoregulatory sweating can be reduced by up to 25%.  Hence, older people may be less sensitive to high humidity and therefore the effects of high humidity are less. As in most studies only people >65 years were included, this may be one explanation for the non-association of humidity on heat stress. Second, it is possible that the threshold at which differences in humidity impact the body’s regulatory mechanisms are rarely attained. This means, that only at a specific threshold of humidity the body’s cooling mechanisms have trouble and this threshold may be reached rarely in especially dry areas. Third, heat-related outcomes may be due to other causes and unaffected of humidity. As cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common reasons for death and high temperatures can lead to cardiovascular deaths, humidity does not play any role and is independent of the death. The last reason is dehydration. Dehydration is a major cause of heat-related deaths. Trough dehydration sweating is reduced, and the potential that high humidity affect evaporation and worsen the cooling mechanism is reduced.[2]

## Heat and Humidity in Studies 
### Humidity definitions 
Humidity has several definitions and one need to be careful which of those is selected to answer a research question. Therefore, it is essential to use an appropriate measure for humidity. Baldwin et al. (2023) describe the four following categories to distinguish between different humidity variables \
1. Simple relative variables including Relative Humidity (RH), Dew-point depression (DPD) and Saturation deficit \
2. Mass-based variables including Specific humidity, absolute humidity, dew point temperature, vapor pressure and mixing ratio \
3. Composite indicators such as the Heat index, Humidex, Wet-bulb-temperature, UTCI... \
4. Physiologic-based humidity indicators including Maximum evaporation, required evaporation, total evaporation[2] \ 
Davis et al. did a review on commonly used humidity variables in epidemiological studies and found that 62% of all the studies they reviewed used RH as a humidity variable, whereas absolute humidity and specific humidity as humidity variables were used in 5.3% and 1.5% of the studies, respectively. Furthermore, the authors discussed how to use the different humidity variables and when it is appropriate to use which one. They recommend using RH as humidity variable sparingly because it is diurnal and seasonal and depends on temperature. Also, RH is strongly (inversely) correlated with temperature. Therefore, Davies et al. recommend using mass water-vapor based variables like absolute or specific humidity as they provide a better measure of exposure to humidity levels than RH. Overall one should be careful in the selection of the humidity variable, as the measure may be highly correlated with other variables of interested, particular temperature. They concluded that mostly it is inappropriate to use RH and if it is used one should use it with caution. [5] 
The great use of RH in epidemiological studies are caused by the available data and the measurements which are done. Mostly, if humidity is measured, then RH is measured and deriving mass water-vapor based variables often leads to uncertainty. 

### Composite Indicators 
As already mentioned in the section ‘humidity definitions’, composite indicators are also a common measure in studies. There are over 120 diagnostic heat stress metrics and they are very useful in the design of heat warning systems [3]. Composite indicators take simultaneously heat, humidity and further variables into account, which on the one hand is practical, as one only uses one index. On the other hand, the interpretation of such an index can be ambiguous, as a change in the index can be driven by heat, humidity or any other variable which is part of this index. This may lead to biased, misleading estimates and the association of heat or humidity may be underestimated. Baldwin et al. recommend the use alternative methods such as confounding or effect modification to separately show effects of heat and humidity. [2]  

### Confounder
A confounder is a variable that influences both, the exposure of interested and the outcome. Figure … shows humidity as a confounder for the effect of temperature on a health outcome. In many epidemiological studies, humidity was used as a confounder for the effect of temperature on health outcomes. It was adjusted for humidity. By adjusting for humidity, we close the backdoor path from heat to health outcome and therefore remove the arrow from humidity to temperature. This leads to a different interpretation of the estimates. We now assume a linear model:
\begin{center}
\[ Ε[Y│t,h]= β_0+ β_1*t+ β_2*h, \]
\end{center}
Where Y is the health outcome of interest, t is temperature and h humidity. β_1 is the conditional total effect of temperature on health outcome, whereas β_2 is the direct effect of humidity relative of humidity. As already mentioned, the interpretation of confounding estimates can be misleading. [2][6]

Another downside of confounding is the potential arise of multicollinearity issues. If the exposure of interested, in our case heat and the confounder, humidity, are highly correlated and one include both variables in one regression model this may lead to multicollinearity problems. Multicollinearity can result in estimates that capture similar information and are therefore difficult to interpret and distinguish individual effects of the variables. Furthermore, the precision of the estimated coefficients may be reduced. If one further includes calendar variables to the model to adjust for long-term or seasonal trends this can further exacerbate multicollinearity if the correlation between temperature and humidity varies greatly over time. Baldwin et al. suggest using alternative approaches to significance testing, which don't rely solely on p-values. Furthermore, the relationship between heat and humidity and their individual effects on health outcomes needs to be carefully considered to avoid misleading results.
