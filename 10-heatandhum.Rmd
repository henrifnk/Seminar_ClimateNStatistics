## Abstract 

As the effects of climate change intensify, the number of heat-related deaths and other negative health outcomes is also rising. Physiologically it is known that not only heat, but also humidity plays a crucial role on the body’s reaction to heat and therefore on death or other health outcomes. Several epidemiological studies tried to show this but found only little or no effect of humidity on negative health outcomes. This leads to a controversial issue between the physiological knowledge and epidemiological studies, which is more discussed in this Chapter now. 

## Introduction 

### Background 

Climate change is a broad and pressing topic as the number of heat-related deaths and the air-temperature break records. Extreme heat waves during summer seasons become a permanent features and therefore heat-related deaths will increase(@ebi). Especially heat and humidity are increased by climate change as both gain higher values as the greenhouse gases rise. Physiologically it is known that heat and humidity are associated with human heat stress and negatively influences the human body.(@baldwin) Heat stress occurs when environmental conditions overwhelm the body‘s cooling mechanism(@buzan). If the body's cooling mechanism is not able to cool down the core temperature this has a negative impact on the health of an individual. This heat stress can lead to extremes to death. From a physiological perspective the mechanism to cool down the body’s core temperature are driven by the heat and humidity the body is surrounded by. Contrary to that, a broad range of epidemiological studies concluded that there is either no or just a weak effect of humidity on human heat stress and negative health outcomes. Those studies all infer that a rise in air-temperature (heat) is associated with negative health outcomes. These two contradictories lead to a controversial issue as physiologically it is known that there is an effect of humidity on health outcomes, whereas in epidemiological studies they did not find an effect of humidity on health outcomes. Figure 1 describes this contradiction between physiological knowledge and epidemiological studies .
Heat in this chapter is used as synonym for high ambient temperature.

### Epidemiological Studies 
Several epidemiological studies investigated the influence of humidity and heat on negative health outcomes such as death or cardiovascular diseases. Results of these studies are mixed regarding the association of humidity with negative health outcomes. A study in New York (US) found a positive association between high levels of relative humidity (RH) and cardio-respiratory hospitalizations. But this study is one of the only ones who found an association between humidity and a negative health outcome. 
Baldwin et al. reviewed several epidemiological studies, did further research, and concluded six key reasons why epidemiological studies found less or even no effect of humidity on health outcomes. 
1) they figured, that at high temperatures there is truly little influence of humidity on health outcomes. 2) limited data sets may influence the results of the studies. 3) analyses focus on vulnerable populations such as older people or people with sweating impairments and thus evaporative impairments. 4) they discuss that extremely high levels of heat and humidity are necessary for humidity to impact the heat strain of subjects. Such extreme events were rarely recorded. 5) the relationship between heat and humidity was not considered properly and therefore the model results may be inappropriate. As last reason they argue that sub-daily meteorological phenomena, such as rain, occur at high heat and humidity, and may bias studies based on daily data.  (@baldwin)

### Physiological background/Knowledge 
Physiologically it is known that heat and humidity should increase the risks for human health. Morbidity, Mortality, reduction in physical work capacity and further negative health outcomes are presumed to increase further with the climate crisis. (@buzan)
The human body has two cooling mechanism to control the body temperature. One way is to redistribute the blood flow towards the skin (vasodilation) such that metabolically generated heat from inside the body reaches the skin’s surface and subsequently the environment. This way of cooling the body down requires an increased blood flow and increases the cardiac demand. People with heart conditions will suffer cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarct and others. 
The other way is to secret sweat onto the skin, which evaporates to the environment and heat from the body is removed. These cooling mechanisms are necessary for the human body to maintain the human core temperature. (@ebi)
This mechanism to cool down the body lose their effectiveness with the increase of heat and humidity. With higher ambient humidity the proportion of sweat that evaporates from the skin to the environment, i.e. the effectiveness of sweating decreases. Hence, sweating does not lead to heat loss anymore which leads to a continuous rise in body temperature. The human body responds to that with further sweating, until enough sweat is generated to evaporate from the skin. But this increase of sweating can lead to heat stroke, dehydration or a sweat rate which exceeds the body's physical limits. (@baldwin)
Furthermore, there are several risk populations for whom the mechanisms of the body to cool itself down are already less efficient or even not working. For example, people older than 65 have a diminished sweating ability. Similarly, people with cardiovascular diseases cannot transport more blood through the heart to redistribute the heat from inside the body to the skin. These are just two examples, but there are more conditions which further influence the mechanisms to cool down the body. (@ebi) Summarizing one can say that if the body is not able to cool itself down anymore one suffers heat stress. 
These physiological conclusions were not observed in most epidemiological studies. Several methodological aspects my lead to such results but also physiological explanations. First, heat-vulnerable people may have sweating impairments and therefore a reduced sweating capacity. Especially with aging the sweating response decreases and above the age of 60 years, thermoregulatory sweating can be reduced by up to 25%. Hence, older people may be less sensitive to high humidity. As in most studies only people >65 years were included and may be one explanation for the non-association of humidity on heat stress. Secondly, it is possible that the threshold at which differences in humidity impact the body’s regulatory mechanisms are rarely attained. This means, that only at a specific threshold of humidity the body’s cooling mechanisms have trouble and this threshold may be reached rarely in especially dry areas. Thirdly, heat-related outcomes may be due to other causes and unaffected by humidity. As cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common reasons for death and high temperatures can lead to cardiovascular deaths, humidity does not play any role and is independent of the death. The last reason is dehydration. Dehydration is a major cause of heat-related deaths. Through dehydration the amount of sweat decreases, and the potential that high humidity affects evaporation and worsens the cooling mechanism is reduced .(@baldwin)

## Heat and Humidity in Studies 
### Humidity definitions 
Humidity has several definitions, and one needs to be careful which of those is selected to answer a research question. Therefore, it is essential to use an appropriate measure for humidity. Baldwin et al. (2023) describe the four following categories to distinguish between different humidity variables \
1. Simple relative variables including Relative Humidity (RH), Dew-point depression (DPD) and Saturation deficit \
2. Mass-based variables including specific humidity, absolute humidity, dew point temperature, vapor pressure and mixing ratio \
3. Composite indicators such as the Heat index, Humidex, Wet-bulb-temperature, UTCI... \
4. Physiologic-based humidity indicators including maximum evaporation, required evaporation, total evaporation \(@baldwin)
Davis et al. reviewed commonly used humidity variables in epidemiological studies and found that 62% of all included studies used RH as a humidity variable, whereas absolute humidity and specific humidity were used in 5.3% and 1.5% of the studies, respectively. Furthermore, the authors discussed how to use the different humidity variables and when it is appropriate to use which one. They recommend using RH as humidity variable sparingly because it is diurnal and seasonal and depends on heat. Also, RH is strongly (inversely) correlated with heat. Therefore, Davies et al. recommend using mass water-vapor based variables like absolute or specific humidity as they provide a better measure of exposure to humidity levels than RH. Overall, one should be careful in the selection of the humidity variable, as the measure may be highly correlated with other variables of interested, particular heat. They concluded that mostly it is inappropriate to use RH and if it is used one should use it with caution. (@davis) 
The widespread use of RH in epidemiological studies is caused by the available data and the measurements which are done. Mostly, if humidity is measured, then RH is measured. Deriving mass water-vapor based variables such as absolute and specific humidity leads to uncertainty and a biased estimate.  

### Composite Indicators 
As already mentioned in the section ‘humidity definitions’, composite indicators are also a common measure in studies. There are over 120 diagnostic heat stress metrics and they are very useful in the design of heat warning systems (@buzan). Composite indicators take simultaneously heat, humidity and further variables into account. Using such composite indexes is highly practical, however comes at the cost of interpretability. Any change in the index can be driven by heat, humidity or any other variable which is part of this index. This may lead to biased, misleading estimates and the association of heat or humidity may be underestimated. Baldwin et al. recommend the use of alternative methods such as confounding or effect modification to separately show effects of heat and humidity. (@baldwin)  

### Confounder
A confounder is a variable that influences both, the exposure of interest and the outcome. Figure 2 shows humidity as a confounder for the effect of heat on a health outcome. 

```{r confounder, cache=FALSE, out.width="500", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics('Confounder.png')
```

**Figure 2:** Humidity as confounding effect.

In many epidemiological studies, humidity was used as a confounder for the effect of heat on health outcomes. It was adjusted for humidity. By adjusting for humidity, we close the backdoor path from heat to health outcome and therefore remove the arrow from humidity to heat. This leads to a different interpretation of the estimates. We now assume a linear model:

$$
Ε[Y│t,h]= β_0+ β_1*t+ β_2*h
$$

Where Y is the health outcome of interest, t is heat and h humidity. $β_1$ is the conditional total effect of heat on health outcome, whereas $β_2$ is the direct effect of relative humidity  on the outcome. As already mentioned, the interpretation of confounding estimates can be misleading. (@baldwin, @westreich) Another downside of confounding is the potential rise of multicollinearity issues. If the exposure of interest, in our case heat and the confounder, humidity, are highly correlated and both variables are included in one regression model this may lead to multicollinearity problems. Multicollinearity can result in estimates that capture similar information and are therefore difficult to interpret and individual effects of the variables are hard to distinguish. Furthermore, the precision of the estimated coefficients may be reduced. If one further includes calendar variables to the model to adjust for long-term or seasonal trends this can further exacerbate multicollinearity if the correlation between heat and humidity varies greatly over time. Baldwin et al. suggest using alternative approaches to significance testing, which do not rely solely on p-values. Furthermore, the relationship between heat and humidity and their individual effects on health outcomes needs to be carefully considered to avoid misleading results. 

### Effect Modification and Interaction 
Including humidity as an effect modifier or interaction with heat is another way to test an effect of humidity in the framework of negative health outcomes and was used in some epidemiological studies (@baldwin). Effect modification and interaction are desirable biases one wants to uncover and understand as they provide valuable insights into how variables interact and influence outcomes. Confounding one wants to eliminate because it distorts relationships between variables. They represent inherent aspects of causal relationships that require clarification. Often, the two terms *Effect Modification* and *Interaction* are used interchangeably. However, from a causal view these two concepts differ in a counterfactual perspective and slightly differ in their definition. The counterfactual perspective is concerned with hypothetical scenarios and deals with “What if?” questions. As an example “What if heat stays the same but humidity would have been lower? Would the effect on the health outcome stay the same?”. (@bours) Both concepts are scale dependent and the presence of effect modification or interaction depends on the scale used. Here, the risk difference scale is used for the formal definitions. 
Interaction refers to the joint, combined causal effect of two exposures, in our case heat and humidity. Effect modification pertains to how the causal effect of one exposure changes across different levels of a second exposure, in our case e.g.: “How does the effect of heat change across different levels of humidity?”. Let T refer to heat, H to humidity and Y to the outcome of interest e.g. heat-related death. $Y^t$ is the counterfactual outcome under exposure t and $Y^{th}$ is the counterfactual outcome under t and h. 
H is Effect Modifier on the risk difference scale for an effect of T on Y if H is not effect of T and there are 2 levels of T, $t_0$,$t_1$ and two levels of H, $h_0$,$h_1$, such that

$$
Ε[Y^{t_1}│H=h_1] - E[Y^{t_0}│H=h_1] ≠ E[Y^{t_1}|H=h_0]- E[Y^{t_0}|H=h_0]
$$
Effect Modification requires a difference between two levels of humidity on the effect of heat on the outcome. By recognizing effect modification, public health interventions can better address the nuanced ways in which heat exposure interacts with humidity levels to influence outcomes. This understanding allows for more targeted strategies to mitigate the health risks associated with specific combinations of heat and humidity.
There is an interaction on the risk difference scale between T and H on Y if there are 2 levels of T, $t_0$,$t_1$ and two levels of H, $h_0$,$h_1$, such that,
$$
Ε[Y^{t_1, h_1}] - E[Y^{t_0, h_1}] ≠ E[Y^{t_1, h_0}]- E[Y^{t_0, h_0}]
$$

Interaction requires that the joint effect of heat and humidity be different to the effect considering them separately and therefore not simply the sum of the individual effects. If there is interaction, studying each exposure separately may not fully capture the complexity of their joint influence on the outcome. (@vanderweele) 
According to Baldwin et al. analytical approaches to estimate interaction of effect modification are similar. They suggest that by including interaction terms or effect modifiers the main question of interest needs to be considered, also the scale of interest and the potential policy implications. (@baldwin)
Unfortunately, the interpretation of interaction terms and effect modifiers often leads to misinterpretation and often the scale (multiplicatively or additive) also is not considered correctly. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the concepts of interaction and effect modification and how to interpret them correctly. 

### Data Limitations 
Weather data may not be available at every location in the world. Furthermore, the quality of the data may differ between the different countries and locations. Especially in low-income countries, for example, in Africa there is less information about the weather than in high-income countries, as they have more capacity to measure the weather. Figure 3 shows global sub-daily weather data from the HadISD data collection. As one can see in Africa, South America, and Australia there are less measurements than in Europe or in the US. Especially in Africa there are striking heat events and missing data leads to missing information and no estimates. Furthermore, tropical locations are not covered well. Unfortunately, tropical, and subtropical climates have high levels of humidity and heat and humidity in combination. How heat and humidity has an effect in subtropics and tropics is consequently not well understood due to such missing data patterns and locations where humidity may have a large effect on health outcomes are not covered in epidemiological studies. Another data limitation may be the temporal resolution of data. Often daily mean measurements are used to test an effect of humidity and heat on health outcomes. Mid-days it is hotter than in the evening or in the morning and the humidity also changes over the day. Correlation between heat and humidity is possibly different in the morning than in the afternoon and this may reduce the role of humidity in epidemiological studies. Further data limitations are the location of the measurement. For instance, often the weather stations are based at the airport outside of the cities, mostly rural areas. Therefore, urban heat effects are not well captured by the data and additionally inside and outside heat and humidity is not considered, as only outside measurements are mostly used. 
One more downside in measuring humidity is that most of the times only relative humidity is measured. As described above, this measure of humidity is probably not the best to use. Other measurements such as specific or absolute humidity can be derived from RH but only with uncertainty. 
Overall, a lack of data can lead to underestimation of the effect of humidity and therefore one should take this lack into account, especially when one wants to generalize the results to other countries and weather conditions. (@baldwin)

## Examples 
Armstrong et al. tested the potential contribution of humidity as an addition to heat on daily mortality in summer using a time series regression model with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DNLM) for heat. Therefore, they used data from 445 cities in 24 countries and fitted different models, especially including a range of humidity terms or an interaction term between heat and humidity were models they fitted. They compared the model fit by using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and figured the best model fit when humidity was included as linear term. For this model, the result was that an increase of 23% in RH (99th percentile) is associated with a 1.1% [CI: 0.8, 1.3] decrease in mortality. This result is not significant and further, shows the opposite direction one suspected. Having a closer look regarding the reasons described before we see RH was used as humidity measure. However, the authors did some sensitivity analyses and included specific humidity and dewpoint as humidity measure. These analyses showed similar results. The model with humidity as effect modifier was not considered based on the AIC (@armstrong). According to Baldwin et al. AIC is not a criterion to decide whether an interaction should be included in a model or not (@baldwin). Hence, it is not known, how an interaction would have changed the results and therefore it is questionable if it would have been more appropriate to include an interaction. The final model they used included RH as linear term and therefore humidity was considered as confounder. As mentioned above, several problems can occur when humidity is used as confounder. The authors itself also mention some limitations, for instance the lack of data from tropical countries and less developed countries, only mortality was considered as endpoint or the possibility that the study may have missed conditions under which humidity may have had an association with mortality different from the average. (@armstrong)
Another example of an epidemiological study was conducted by Schwartz et al. They measured the effect of heat and humidity on hospital admission for heart disease and myocardial infarction in persons older than 64 years in 12 US cities. They fitted a poisson model for each city and used regression splines to control for season and barometric pressure. Furthermore, they controlled for the day of the week. The effect and lag structure of heat and humidity was estimated by a distributed lag model. They concluded that hospital admission for all heart disease increased with average heat in both, hot and cold climates. Further, they found no evidence for an effect of humidity. Possible explanations of the results in this study are the use of RH may have introduced bias and/or the use of humidity as a confounder may introduce bias as explained above. Furthermore, the study was only conducted in people aged older than 64 years, and it is known that older people are more vulnerable to heat and sweating impairments. This also may have introduced bias in this study. (@schwartz)
One study which could show an effect of humidity on mortality rates in the US was from Barreca [REF]. He tested the effect of humidity and heat on mortality rates in a huge nationally representative sample in 373 well-populated counties in the US. Barreca used specific humidity in his models and found for both, the heat-mortality and humidity-mortality a U-shaped relationship. Interestingly, without controlling for humidity, he found a 0.9% decline in mortality rates. Therefore, when humidity is ignored, the costs of climate change are underestimated. Barreca included humidity as covariate and an interaction term between heat and humidity. One key point the author explains is that he did the first study with a huge representative sample. Studies with small sample sizes, for instance Schwartz et al. who only rely on 12 US cities, are likely to have little identifying variation from which to distinguish the effects of specific humidity from heat. (@barreca)
Budd did a summary on the history and limitations of the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index. This index is the most-widely used index and was invented for the United States Army and Marine Corps in 1950. The WBGT index has four basic elements of thermal environment: air temperature, mean radiant temperature, absolute humidity, and air movement. Budd mentions several limitations of this index. First, the index underestimates the stress of restricted evaporation. This is because at a given level of the index the environment is more stressful when the evaporation of sweat is restricted, i.e. by high levels of humidity and low air movement, than when evaporation is free. Second, the interpretation of such an index needs to be done carefully and can lead to errors. Especially it is not possible to separate the effect of heat and humidity and we lose information when using the WBGT index. Third, the accuracy of sweat is restricted by measurement errors e.g. through unsatisfying calibration methods or non-standard instrumentation. 

## Discussion 
There are several possible reasons why epidemiological studies show different result than expected, especially when it comes to the effect of humidity on health outcomes. When considering an epidemiological study, one should be aware of how to use humidity. As described above, humidity can be used as confounder, effect modifier or in a composite index, but one should be aware of the limitations here. Furthermore, the different measures of humidity need to be known and mass water-vapor based variables such as specific or absolute humidity are recommended. Overall, it is important to have the research question and/or hypothesis in mind, when thinking about humidity in studies. 
More work needs to be done for the data collection, such that tropical climates and low-income countries are also covered in the study. Also, the use of only vulnerable populations in a study can bias the results and one should thrive for a representative population. 
Humidity is an interesting factor and not only heat should be considered in studies with health outcomes as endpoint. Planning and conducting studies to test an effect of heat and humidity on health outcomes needs knowledge about humidity, the correct use of it in a model, the limitations, and errors one can make by including humidity. This short chapter gave a quick overview on the use of humidity in epidemiological studies.
