## Introduction

The 2023 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change (@romanello20232023) aims to monitor the evolving impact of climate change on health and the emerging health opportunities of climate action. It is in its eighth iteration and was created by 114 scientists and health practitioners from 52 research institutions and UN agencies from all continents (but Antarctica). 

The current report focuses on 47 indicators, tracking changes based on observed data as well as projections, in the following fields:

#. Health hazards, exposures, and impacts
#. Adaptation, planning, and resilience for health
#. Mitigation actions and health co-benefits
#. Economics and fincance
#. Public and political engagement with health and climate change

The remainder of this chapter provides some background information on climate models, detailed information on three indicators, and a conclusion.

## Background

Shared Socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (@RIAHI2017153) were established by the climate research community in order to make the analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation possible. They describe alternative socioeconomic developments regarding their energy, land use, and emissions implications, e.g. more or less renewable energy vs. fossile fuels. The following SSPs are of interest for the rest of this chapter:

#. SSP1: Sustainability (low challenges to mitigation and adaption), corresponding to a 2°C emission scenario
#. SSP3: Regional Rivalry (high challenges to mitigation and adaptation), corresponding to a 3.7°C emission scenario

These pathways are considered by climate models, e.g. CMIP6 (@gmd-9-1937-2016), in order to describe multiple scenarios for climate projections. Figure \@ref(fig:cmip6) shows CMIP6 simulations for multiple models and all SSPs. In this chapter, we consider SSP1, representing a sustainable path, and SSP3, representing a non-sustainable path, which humanity is following right now.

## Selected Indicators

We selected three indicators from the first field (Health hazards, exposures, and impacts) with detailed descriptions and outcomes.

### Indicator 1.1.2: Exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves

Heatwaves have a severe or even life-threatening impact on human health, e.g. high temperatures can cause heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat syncope, and heat cramps (see for example @doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061832 or @chambers2020). The following variables (among others) can influence mortality: increased risk for older adults (>65 years of age), low-income countries due to a reduced number of health workers, or pre-existing cardiovascular and chronic respiratory conditions.

This indicator tracks the number of heatwave days and the exposure of vulnerable populations (older adults and infants <1 years of age) to heatwaves. A heatwave day is a period of 2 or more days where both the minimum and maximum temperatures are above the 95th percentile of temperatures in 1986-2005.

### Indicator 1.1.5: Heat-related mortality

## Conclusion

sdfdsf

In yearly reports one of the leading scientific journals in health research 
gives an overview on the state of the art knowledge on the effect of climate 
change on health (@romanello20232023).  The following aspects should be treated: 



#. Main results and message 
#.  Communication of results 
#. Arguments based on statistical methods
