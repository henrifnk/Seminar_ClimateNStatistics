The quantification and definition of climate change, extreme events and its implications for life and health on our planet is one of the major concerns in climate science. This book explains current statistical methods in climate science and their application. The methods include compound events, low flow events and return periods, natural variability, teleconnections and causal discovery. All of those methods are used to quantify and anticipate the changing climate. This book is the outcome of the seminar “Climate and Statistics” which took place in summer 2024 at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich.

"],["foreword.html", "Foreword Technical Setup", " Foreword Author: Christoph Molnar This book is the result of an experiment in university teaching. Each semester, students of the Statistics Master can choose from a selection of seminar topics. Usually, every student in the seminar chooses a scientific paper, gives a talk about the paper and summarizes it in the form of a seminar paper. The supervisors help the students, they listen to the talks, read the seminar papers, grade the work and then … hide the seminar papers away in (digital) drawers. This seemed wasteful to us, given the huge amount of effort the students usually invest in seminars. An idea was born: Why not create a book with a website as the outcome of the seminar? Something that will last at least a few years after the end of the semester. In the summer term 2019, some Statistics Master students signed up for our seminar entitled “Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning”. When they came to the kick-off meeting, they had no idea that they would write a book by the end of the semester. We were bound by the examination rules for conducting the seminar, but otherwise we could deviate from the traditional format. We deviated in several ways: Each student project is part of a book, and not an isolated seminar paper. We gave challenges to the students, instead of papers. The challenge was to investigate a specific limitation of interpretable machine learning methods. We designed the work to live beyond the seminar. We emphasized collaboration. Students wrote some chapters in teams and reviewed each others texts. Technical Setup The book chapters are written in the Markdown language. The simulations, data examples and visualizations were created with R (rlang?). To combine R-code and Markdown, we used rmarkdown. The book was compiled with the bookdown package. We collaborated using git and github. For details, head over to the book’s repository.

This variability can be due to a variety of factors, including atmospheric processes, ocean currents, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and other dynamic components of the Earth system. Natural variability occurs across all time scales, from short-term (daily, seasonal) to long-term (decadal, centennial) fluctuations. 2.1 Climate Model Ensemble Climate models are sophisticated tools that simulate the interactions within the Earth’s climate system. To understand and quantify natural variability, scientists use ensembles of climate model simulations. An ensemble consists of multiple runs of the same model, or different models, where each run has slightly different initial conditions or model parameters. This approach helps to capture the range of possible climate outcomes due to the inherent uncertainty and variability in the system. 2.2 Internal Variability Within the context of climate model ensembles, internal variability refers to the variations in climate that arise from the system’s internal processes, independent of external forcings. This variability is a fundamental part of the climate system’s dynamics and can lead to different outcomes even if the external conditions are the same. (deser?)

It captures water deficits or surpluses on the land surface better than the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), which focuses solely on precipitation. The potential evaporation can be based on the so-called FAO grass evaporation, which takes into account radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed over a standard grass area. The time series is broken down into 12 monthly frequency sums, to each of which a cumulative log-logistic distribution is fitted. This is transformed into a corresponding cumulative standard normal distribution, the abscissa value of which - referred to as SPEI - allows simple assignment to probability classes. (vicente?) "],["ce.html", "Chapter 4 Compound events 4.1 Example: Hot and Dry Events", " Chapter 4 Compound events Author: Author Supervisor: Henri Funk Suggested degree: Master In climate research, a compound event refers to the combination of multiple extreme weather or climate events occurring simultaneously or successively, leading to significant impacts on the environment, society, or economy. These events can be related either through meteorological factors (e.g., heatwaves and drought occurring together due to a prolonged high-pressure system) or through their impacts (e.g., heavy rainfall and storm surge combining to cause more severe flooding). The complexity of compound events lies in their interconnectedness and the way they can exacerbate each other’s effects, often in a nonlinear manner, making them more challenging to predict and manage than individual extreme events. 4.1 Example: Hot and Dry Events Consider a scenario where a region experiences both extreme heat and an extended period of low precipitation simultaneously. In this example, the compound nature of the hot and dry events creates a cascade of impacts that are more severe than what would be expected if these events occurred independently. The interplay between the heat and drought amplifies the consequences, underscoring the importance of understanding and managing compound events in the context of climate change and variability.

These relationships are critical for modeling the joint behavior of these variables, which can be essential for predicting weather events, designing structures, or managing natural resources. In the study of environmental and hydrological systems, recognizing and accurately modeling the asymmetry in bivariate relationships is crucial for making reliable predictions and informed decisions. Techniques such as copulas, are often used in this context to model and analyze these complex and dependencies effectively. To model the asymmetry in dependencies, Archimax could be used.

Teleconnections represent atmospheric interactions that link weather and climate conditions in one region of the globe with those in another, often through the movement and behavior of large-scale atmospheric wave patterns. These connections are crucial for understanding regional climate variations, predicting weather patterns, and assessing climate change impacts. 6.1 North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Its Implications The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a prime example of a teleconnection pattern, characterized by variations in the difference of atmospheric pressure at sea level between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. The NAO influences weather and climate conditions across the North Atlantic region and beyond, affecting winter temperatures and storm tracks. 6.2 Implications for Our Climate Understanding the NAO and other teleconnection patterns is essential for accurate weather forecasting, climate prediction, and the development of strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate variability and change. Researchers use observations, climate models, and paleoclimate reconstructions to study these patterns, aiming to improve our ability to predict their future behavior under different climate change scenarios.

These events can result from prolonged periods of below-average precipitation, increased water usage, or changes in land use that affect the hydrological cycle. Low flow conditions can compromise water quality, reduce water availability for agricultural, industrial, and domestic uses, and disrupt aquatic ecosystems. 7.1 Concept of Extremeness by Return Periods The “extremeness” of hydrological events, including low flow conditions, is often characterized by return periods. A return period, also known as a recurrence interval, is a statistical measure used to estimate the frequency at which a certain intensity of an event (e.g., flow rate, rainfall amount) is likely to be equaled or exceeded. It is typically expressed in years. Definition: The return period is calculated based on historical data and is intended to provide an estimate of the likelihood of experiencing an event of a certain magnitude or greater within any given year. For example, a 100-year return period for a low flow event means that, on average, the flow rate is expected to fall to that level or lower once every 100 years. This does not imply the events will occur exactly 100 years apart but rather conveys a 1% chance of occurrence in any given year. (du?)

These models help in water resource management, flood forecasting, environmental protection, and understanding the impact of climate change on water resources. There are mainly two types of hydrological models: physical and statistical. 8.1 Physical Hydrological Models Physical hydrological models are based on the physical processes that occur within the hydrological cycle. They use mathematical representations of these processes to simulate the behavior of water in the environment. Physical models consider processes such as precipitation, evaporation, infiltration, surface runoff, and groundwater flow. These models are often more complex and require detailed data about the terrain, soil properties, vegetation, and meteorological conditions. 8.2 Statistical Hydrological Models Statistical hydrological models use historical data to identify patterns and relationships between different hydrological variables. These models apply statistical methods to predict future water conditions based on past observations. They do not necessarily simulate the physical processes but rather rely on the statistical properties of the data, such as trends, cycles, and variability. Statistical models are often used when the physical processes are too complex to model directly or when there is insufficient data to build a detailed physical model. (sabzipour?)

(2023)) aims to monitor the evolving impact of climate change on health and the emerging health opportunities of climate action. It is in its eighth iteration and was created by 114 scientists and health practitioners from 52 research institutions and UN agencies from all continents (but Antarctica). While this chapter is based on the 2023 report, there are also regional reports available, such as the 2024 report for Europe (Daalen et al. (2024)). The current report focuses on 47 indicators, tracking changes based on observed data as well as projections, in the following fields: Health hazards, exposures, and impacts Adaptation, planning, and resilience for health Mitigation actions and health co-benefits Economics and fincance Public and political engagement with health and climate change The remainder of this chapter provides some background information on climate models, detailed information on three indicators, and a discussion. 9.2 Background Shared Socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (Riahi et al. (2017)) were established by the climate research community in order to make the analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation possible. They describe alternative socioeconomic developments regarding their energy, land use, and emissions implications, e.g. more or less renewable energy vs. fossil fuels. The following SSPs are of interest for the rest of this chapter: SSP1: Sustainability (low challenges to mitigation and adaption), corresponding to a 2°C emission scenario SSP3: Regional Rivalry (high challenges to mitigation and adaptation), corresponding to a 3.7°C emission scenario These pathways are considered by climate models, e.g. CMIP6 (Eyring et al. (2016)), in order to describe multiple scenarios for climate projections. Figure 9.1 shows CMIP6 simulations for multiple models and all SSPs. In this chapter, we consider SSP1, representing a sustainable path, and SSP3, representing a non-sustainable path, which humanity is following right now. FIGURE 9.1: CMIP6 climate simulations for SSPs with projections until 2100 (https://www.dkrz.de/en/communication/climate-simulations/cmip6-en/cmip6-acivities-at-dkrz-overview?set_language=en; accessed on July 10, 2024) 9.3 Selected Indicators We selected three indicators from the first field (Health hazards, exposures, and impacts) with detailed descriptions and outcomes. 9.3.1 Indicator 1.1.2: Exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves Heatwaves have a severe or even life-threatening impact on human health, e.g. high temperatures can cause heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat syncope, and heat cramps (see, for example, Alahmad et al. (2023) or Chambers (2020b)). The following variables (among others) can influence mortality: increased risk for older adults (&gt;65 years of age), low-income countries due to a reduced number of health workers, or pre-existing cardiovascular and chronic respiratory conditions. This indicator tracks the number of heatwave days and the exposure of vulnerable populations (older adults and infants &lt;1 years of age) to heatwaves. A heatwave day is a period of 2 or more days where both the minimum and maximum temperatures are above the 95th percentile of temperatures in 1986-2005. The following datasets were used for this indicator: ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels (Hersbach et al. (2020)): World-wide weather data on a lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees from 1940 onwards. ISIMP3b Bias Adjustment dataset (Lange (2021)): A bias adjusted and downscaled version of the output of CMIP6 climate models with projections up to the year 2100. Hybrid gridded demographic data for the world (Chambers (2020a)): Demographics data from 1950-2020 with 5-year population bands and a 0.5 degree grid. 2020 Revision of World Population Prospects (https://population.un.org/wpp/): This dataset contains population estimates as well as projections for 237 countries or areas between 1950 and 2100. A global downscaled age structure dataset for assessing human impacts of climate change (Briggs (2021)): This dataset contains historic population estimates starting in 1970 and projections considering SSP1 and SSP3 in a 0.5 degree grid. Headline Finding: “In 2013-2022, infants and people over 65 experienced, on average, 108% more days of heatwave per year than in 1986-2005.” Figures 9.2 and 9.3 show the increase in the number of heatwave days, comparing the time periods 1986-2005 and 2013-2022, for infants and older adults, respectively. This increase (or decrease for Portugal) per country can be calculated, for example, through ERA5 monthly averaged weather data and the hybrid gridded demographics dataset. FIGURE 9.2: Change in number of heatwave days per country for infants, comparing the time periods 1986-2005 and 2013-2022. FIGURE 9.3: Change in number of heatwave days per country for older adults, comparing the time periods 1986-2005 and 2013-2022. The change in the number of heatwave days ranges from approximately -1 in Portugal to 16 in Tajikistan, with only minimal differences between infants and older adults. Similarly, the ISIMP3b Bias Adjustment dataset combined with the global downscaled age structure dataset can be used to project the change in heatwave days up until the year 2100. Figures 9.4 and 9.5 show the projected change in heatwave days for older adults at mid-century (2041-2060) with baseline period 1995-2014. For example, the increase for Venezuela ranges from approximately 88 (SSP1) to 153 (SSP3) heatwave days per year. FIGURE 9.4: Projections of the change in number of heatwave days for older adults per country for SSP1 (under 2 degree scenario) for mid-century (2041-2060) with baseline period 1995-2014. FIGURE 9.5: Projections of the change in number of heatwave days for older adults per country for SSP3 (3.7 degree scenario) for mid-century (2041-2060) with baseline period 1995-2014. 9.3.2 Indicator 1.1.5: Heat-related mortality This indicator is tracking days with temperatures exceeding safe levels for humans and heat-related mortality. Only older adults are considered. Similar datasets are used here as for the previous indicator. However, the difficulty arises due to the fact that safe temperatures may vary across regions (see Honda et al. (2014)). Headline Finding: “In 2018-2022, people experienced on average 86 days of health-threatening high temperatures annually. 60% of such temperatures were made more than twice as likely to occur by human-caused climate change.” Therefore, Honda et al. (2014) created the notion of an Optimum Temperature (OT), at which the mortality is the lowest. Figure 9.6 shows an example for the Tokyo Prefecture and the period 1972-2008. A smoothing spline with six degrees of freedom was used to model the Relative Risk (RR) for mortality and observed daily maximum temperature data. OT represents the daily maximum temperature where RR is the lowest. RR was used here in order to account for different populations of regions and an RR=1.0 is the reference mortality at around OT, i.e. the average number of deaths observed when the daily maximum temperature was within the range of the 75th to the 85th percentile for each year. FIGURE 9.6: A smoothing spline with six degrees of freedom was used for temperature data from the Tokyo Prefecture and the period 1972-2008, showing the daily maximum temperatures and the Relative Risk (RR) for mortality. The shaded area to the right of OT represents temperatures with increased mortality, i.e. daily maximum temperatures above OT are considered as risky for older adults. The average OT percentile of 47 Japanese prefectures was 83.6, which was used to decide which daily maximum temperatures exceeded safe levels for this indicator. In addition, a distributed lag nonlinear model (Armstrong (2006)) was used to model the increase in mortality (represented by RR) depending on temperature. This model is considered as a response function, which can be used to calculate the RR and therefore the absolute increase of mortality depending on the observed or projected temperatures. Figure 9.7 shows the increase in the number of days with unsafe temperatures (daily maximum temperatures exceeding OT). This includes the increasing number of days that were made at least twice as likely due to human induced climate change (it is not described how the red line was created). FIGURE 9.7: Average number of days with unsafe temperatures for older adults from 1997 to 2022, including days that are twice as likely due to climate change. In addition, Figures 9.8 and 9.9 show the absolute projected increase in heat-related mortality per country for older adults at mid-century (2041-2060) compared to 1995-2014 as baseline, for SSP1 and SSP3, respectively. In both cases there is an increase, although it seems that the two scenarios, SSP1 and SSP3, have been flipped accidentially. In addition, only the absolute increase is shown, i.e. it is obvious that highly populated countries, such as India and China, have a very high increase compared to smaller countries. FIGURE 9.8: Projections of the absolute change in heat-related mortality for older adults per country for SSP1 (under 2 degree scenario) for mid-century (2041-2060) with baseline period 1995-2014. FIGURE 9.9: Projections of the absolute change in heat-related mortality for older adults per country for SSP3 (3.7 degree scenario) for mid-century (2041-2060) with baseline period 1995-2014. The response function is kept constant for these projections, i.e. adaptation is ignored for this indicator. Also, absolute numbers of mortality are used here, i.e. it was not distinguished between heat-related deaths and other causes. 9.3.3 Indicator 1.4: Food insecurity and undernutrition In 2022, 725 million people faced hunger and in 2021, 3.1 billion people were unable to afford a healthy diet (“The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023” (2023)). For example, climate change is undermining crop yields, affecting labour capacity, and threatening food security of marine resources. In addition to the previously mentioned datasets, specifically ERA5 and ISIMP3b, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) (Cafiero, Viviani, and Nord (2018)) was used. This dataset contains survey data from 153 countries and territories during the years 2014, 2015, and 2016. Among others, people were asked for whether they experienced moderate or severe food insecurity within the past 12 months. This was matched with weather data in these peoples specific regions in order to find out whether they experienced heatwaves (as previously defined) or drought months (12-monthly SPEI; only during the growth season of specific crops). In order to make predictions for all other years, including the future, a time-varying panel regression model was used (without further detail). The goal was to predict the percentage of people reporting food insecurity based on heatwaves and drought months experienced within a specific year. Headline Finding: “The higher frequency of heatwave days and drought months in 2021 compared to 1981–2010, is associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity.” Figure 9.10 shows world-wide predictions of the change in percentage points (using the previously mentioned model) for heatwaves and drought months for the period 2014-2021. As temperatures, number of heatwave days as well as number of drought months increase, more people are expected to experience severe or moderate food insecurity. FIGURE 9.10: Impact of extreme weather (heatwaves and droughts) on food insecurity from 2014-2021, based on survey data. Figures 9.11 and 9.12 show projections (SSP1 and SSP3, respectively) for the percentage point changes for both kinds of extreme weather combined for mid-century (2014-2060), compared to the baseline 1995-2014. For example for Somalia, this change ranges from 4.02 (SSP1) to 10.32 (SSP3). FIGURE 9.11: Projections of the impact of extreme weather on food inscurity per country for SSP1 (under 2 degree scenario) for mid-century (2041-2060) with baseline period 1995-2014. FIGURE 9.12: Projections of the impact of extreme weather on food inscurity per country for SSP3 (3.7 degree scenario) for mid-century (2041-2060) with baseline period 1995-2014. It is unclear why for many countries there is missing data. 9.4 Discussion The 2023 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the impact of climate change on health and opportunities of climate action. 47 indicators are used to keep track of where humanity is at right now. We provided detailed descriptions of three main indicators and the modelling techniques used, if mentioned. However, there are a few issues discovered: These modelling techniques are typically not described in much detail. Sometimes, as in the case for Honda et al. (2014), some more information is provided in cited articles, but still on a relatively high level. The baselines for comparisons or projections vary. It is not clear, nor described, why different baselines are used. For projections, it is obvious that the baseline for CMIP6 projections (1995-2014) was used, without information on why not the one that was previously used for the indicator at hand. In general, the main findings are reported, without going much into detail on how the authors came up with these. In some cases, e.g. indicator 1.1.5, cited articles provide more information, but in other cases, e.g. indicator 1.4, it seems to be mainly the authors own work, without providing details.

In the chapters before it was mainly talked about temperature related outcomes. This chapter focuses on heat events and how humidity plays a crucial role in high ambient temperatures and the effect on health outcomes. Physiological research indicates that both heat and humidity significantly impact the body’s response to heat. Thus, influencing mortality and adverse health outcomes. Several epidemiological studies aimed to show this relationship, found however only minimal or even no effect of humidity on negative health outcomes. This discrepancy between physiological knowledge and epidemiological findings creates a, as (Baldwin et al. (2023)) describes it, controversial issue. This will be further explored in this chapter. 11.2 Introduction 11.2.1 Background Climate change is a broad and pressing topic as the number of heat-related deaths and the air-temperature break records. Extreme heat waves have become a consistent feature of summer seasons, leading to an increase in heat-related fatalities (K. L.Ebi (2021)). Rising greenhouse gas concentrations further contribute to rising temperatures and humidity at the same time. Physiological knowledge indicates that heat and humidity both contribute to human heat stress, adversely affecting the human body (Baldwin et al. (2023)). Heat stress occurs when environmental conditions overwhelm the body‘s cooling mechanism (R.Buzan and M.Huber (2020)). When the body is not able to sufficiently lower its core temperature, the human body suffers health problems, potentially leading to death. From a physiological perspective, the body’s cooling mechanisms are clearly influenced both by heat and humidity. In contrast, a wide range of epidemiological studies have found either no or only a weak correlation between humidity and human heat stress or adverse health outcomes. Those studies all infer that a rise in air-temperature (heat) is associated with negative health outcomes. These two contradictions lead, according to (Baldwin et al. (2023)), to a controversial issue as physiologically it is known that there is an effect of humidity on health outcomes, whereas in epidemiological studies they did not find evidence for such an effect. Figure 1 describes this contradiction between physiological knowledge and epidemiological studies. Heat in this chapter is used as synonym for high ambient temperature. Figure 1: Flowchart illustrating the controversial issue between epidemiological studies and physiological knowledge. A: illustrates how heat and humidity changes with climate change. B: illustrates that epidemiological studies only take heat as driver into account, the physiological view heat and humidity. C: shows the predictions from an epidemiological and physiological view. 11.2.2 Epidemiological Studies Numerous epidemiological studies investigated the influence of heat and humidity on negative health outcomes such as death or cardiovascular diseases. Results of these studies are mixed regarding the association of humidity and negative health outcomes. As an example, a study in New York, conducted by Barreca found a positive correlation between high levels of relative humidity (RH) and cardio-respiratory hospitalizations. However, this study is one of few that identified an effect of humidity on negative health outcomes. Baldwin et al. reviewed several epidemiological studies and conducted further research. They concluded six key reasons why epidemiological studies found less or even no effect of humidity on health outcomes: At high temperatures, humidity has minimal or even no influence on negative health outcomes Study results may be skewed by limited data sets Analyses often focus on vulnerable populations, like elderly, infants or individuals with impaired sweating functions Necessary extreme values of heat and humidity to show a significant impact on heat strain are rare The relationship between heat and humidity is often not adequately considered. This may lead to inappropriate model results Sub-daily meteorological phenomena, such as rain, which occur during high heat and humidity, may bias studies based on daily data (Baldwin et al. (2023)). 11.2.3 Physiological knowledge Physiological evidence indicates that heat and humidity increase health risks, leading to higher rates of morbidity, mortality, reduced physical work capacity, and other adverse health outcomes as the climate crisis worsens. (R.Buzan and M.Huber (2020)) The human body has two primary cooling mechanism to control the body temperature. One mechanism redistributes the blood flow to the skin (vasodilation), and therefore allows metabolically generated heat from inside of the body to reach the skin’s surface and subsequently the environment. This process requires an increased blood flow and elevates cardiac demand. This may trigger cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction in subjects with heart conditions. The second mechanism involves secreting sweat onto the skin. Subsequently, the sweat evaporates to the environment and heat from the body is removed. These two mentioned cooling mechanisms are crucial for the human body to maintain a sustainable core temperature. (K. L.Ebi (2021)) The effectiveness of these cooling mechanisms decline with the increase of heat and humidity. A higher ambient humidity reduces the proportion of sweat that evaporates from the skin into the air. Hence, the effectiveness of sweating decreases and sweating does not lead to heat loss anymore, causing a rise in body temperature. The human body responds to such ineffective sweating by an even higher rate of sweating. This can lead to heat stroke, dehydration, or the body’s physical limits may simply be exceeded. (Baldwin et al. (2023)) Certain populations are at higher risk due to less efficient cooling mechanisms. For instance, people older than 65 years may have a reduced sweating ability same as individuals with cardiovascular diseases who cannot effectively increase blood flow to the skin. These factors, among others, exacerbate the difficulty in cooling the body. (K. L.Ebi (2021)) When the body can no longer cool itself, heat stress occurs. However, these physiological insights are not consistently reflected in epidemiological studies. Several methodological and physiological factors might explain this discrepancy. Firstly, heat-vulnerable individuals often have impaired sweating capacities, especially with aging this capacity decreases. Thermoregulatory sweating can decrease by up to 25% in individuals older than 60. Consequently, they will be less sensitive to high humidity. Since most studies only include individuals over 65 years, this might explain the lack of association between humidity and heat stress. Secondly, it is possible that the threshold at which differences in humidity impact the body’s regulatory mechanisms are rarely attained. This means, that only at a specific threshold of humidity the body’s cooling mechanisms have trouble and this threshold may be reached rarely in especially dry areas. Thirdly, heat-related outcomes may result from other causes unrelated to humidity. For example, cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death, and high temperatures can exacerbate these conditions independently of humidity. Lastly, dehydration, a major cause of heat-related deaths, reduces the amount of sweat, thereby minimizing the impact of high humidity on evaporation and cooling. (Baldwin et al. (2023)) 11.3 Heat and Humidity in Studies 11.3.1 Humidity definitions Humidity has multiple definitions. This makes it crucial to select an appropriate measure to answer specific research questions. (Baldwin et al. (2023)) categorize humidity variables into the four following groups: Simple relative variables including Relative Humidity (RH), Dew-point depression (DPD) and Saturation deficit. Mass-based variables including specific humidity, absolute humidity, dew point temperature, vapor pressure and mixing ratio. Composite indicators such as the Heat index, Humidex, Wet-bulb-temperature, UTCI and further more. Physiologic-based humidity indicators including maximum evaporation, required evaporation, total evaporation. The simple relative variable RH (%) is the ratio of actual vapor pressure (e) in the air to the saturation vapor pressure (\\(e_s\\)), indicating proximity to saturation (\\(RH=e/e_s\\)). The dew-point depression (DPD) (°C) indicates the relative dryness of the air and is the difference between the near-surface air temperature (\\(T_a\\)) and the dew point temperature (\\(T_d\\)) (\\(DPD=T_a-T_d\\)). Saturation deficit refers to the amount by which the water vapor must be increased in a given environment to reach saturation, assuming unchanged temperature and pressure. The mass-based variable specific humidity (q) (g/kg) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor (g) to the total mass of moist air (kg). Absolute humidity is the density of water vapor, defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor (g) to the volume of the air mixture (\\(m^3\\)). The dew point temperature (\\(T_d\\)) (°C) is the temperature at which saturation occurs. The mixing ratio (w) refers to the ratio of the mass of water vapor (g) to the mass of dry air (kg). The Heat Index (HI) describes a “feels like” temperature, while the Humidex is a discomfort index. The wet-bulb temperature is the temperature at which air becomes saturated through evaporation at constant pressure. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) (°C) is a physiologically based thermal stress scale designed to reflect the average human physiological response to the outdoor thermal environment. The physiological-based humidity indicator maximum evaporation (\\(E_{max}\\)) represents the maximal evaporation rate in a given environment and clothing conditions. The required evaporation (\\(E_{req}\\)) measures the evaporation needed to achieve thermal balance, and the total evaporation (E) is the total amount of heat lost via evaporation of sweat from the body. Davis et al. reviewed the use of humidity variables in epidemiological studies. They found that 62% of the studies used RH, while absolute and specific humidity were used in only 5.3% and 1.5% of the studies, respectively. They discussed the appropriate use of different humidity variables, especially the use of RH due to its strong inverse correlation with temperature and its diurnal and seasonal variability was mentioned. It is recommended to use RH sparingly. Instead, they recommend using mass-based variables such as absolute or specific humidity, as they provide a more accurate measure of exposure to humidity levels. The selection of humidity variables must be done carefully, they can be highly correlated with other variables, for example with heat. Davis et al. concluded that using RH as humidity variable is often inappropriate and should be done with caution if necessary. (Davis (2016)) The widespread use of RH in epidemiological studies is largely caused by the available data and the measurements which are performed. Mostly, if humidity is measured, then RH is measured. Deriving mass water-vapor based variables such as absolute and specific humidity can introduce uncertainty and bias in estimates. 11.3.2 Composite Indicators Composite indicators are frequently used in studies. There are over 120 heat stress metrics available (R.Buzan and M.Huber (2020)), most of which were originally designed for heat warning systems. Composite indicators consider heat, humidity, and additional variables simultaneously, making them practical for certain applications. Often they are just a weighted sum of different variables. Using such composite indices is very practical, but it comes at the cost of interpretability. Changes in the composite index can result from variations in heat, humidity, or other included variables. Therefore, information about individual effects is lost and the effects can not be separated. Furthermore, the use of such indices may lead to biased or misleading estimates. Hence, the effects of heat or humidity may be underestimated. Baldwin et al. recommend the use of alternative methods such as confounding or effect modification, to separately assess the effects of heat and humidity (Baldwin et al. (2023)). 11.3.3 Confounder A confounder is a variable that affects both the exposure of interest and the outcome. Figure 2 illustrates how humidity acts as a confounder in the relationship between heat and health outcomes. Figure 2: Humidity as confounding effect. Humidity has been used in many epidemiological studies as a confounder when the effect of heat on health outcomes was analyzed. Researchers aim to remove the confounding influence of humidity on the relationship between heat and health outcomes by adjusting for humidity. This means the indirect effect of humidity through heat will be eliminated. Not adjusting for confounder variables, the causal effect of heat may be overestimated. This adjustment leads to a different interpretation of the estimates, as shown in the following linear model: \\[ Ε[Y│t,h]= β_0+ β_1*t+ β_2*h \\] Y represents the health outcome of interest, t is heat, and h humidity. In this model, \\(β_1\\) represents the conditional total effect of heat on the health outcome at any given level of humidity. \\(β_2\\) represents the direct effect of humidity on the outcome. That is the causal effect of humidity on the outcome when heat is held fixed and thus blocking the humidity effect on heat. Interpretation of estimates can however get very complex and sometimes even misleading.Consequently, the causal relation between the variables needs to be considered carefully (Baldwin et al. (2023), Westreich D. (2013)) One significant problem of adjusting for confounding is to potentially run into multicollinearity issues. If heat (the exposure of interest) and humidity (the confounder) are highly correlated and both variables are included in the same regression model multicollinearity is present. Consequently, the estimates capture similar information and therefore making it difficult to interpret individual variable effects. Additionally, the precision of the estimated coefficients may be reduced. Including further variables such as calendar variables to adjust for long-term or seasonal trends can exacerbate multicollinearity if the correlation between heat and humidity varies significantly over time. Furthermore, including other variables which are highly correlated with heat and humidity will lead to further multicollinearity issues. Baldwin et al. suggest using alternative approaches to significance testing that do not rely solely on p-values. Furthermore, it is crucial to carefully consider the relationship between heat and humidity and their individual effects on health outcomes to avoid misleading results. (Baldwin et al. (2023)) 11.3.4 Effect Modification and Interaction Including humidity as an effect modifier or interaction with heat is another method to test an effect of humidity in the framework of negative health outcomes and was used in some epidemiological studies (Baldwin et al. (2023)). Unlike confounding, which distorts relationships and should therefore be eliminated, effect modification and interaction are desirable biases. They provide valuable insights into how variables interact and influence outcomes, revealing inherent aspects of causal relationships that need clarification. Often, the two terms Effect Modification and Interaction are used interchangeably. However, from a causal view these two concepts differ in a counterfactual perspective and slightly differ in their definition. The counterfactual perspective involves hypothetical scenarios, asking “What if?” questions such as, “What if heat remained the same but humidity was lower? Would the health outcome change?”. (Bours (2021)) Counterfactual outcomes are typically written with a superscript such as \\(Y^t\\) and answers the question: “What would the outcome Y be if the exposure was t?”. Or as another example \\(Y^{th}\\) answers the question: “What would the outcome Y be if both exposures t and h occurred together?”. As in real-world data typically not all combinations of exposures are observed in each individual we are talking about hypothetical scenarios. Both concepts are scale dependent and their presence depends on the scale used. Here, we use the risk difference scale for formal definitions. Interaction refers to the combined causal effect of two exposures, such as heat and humidity. Effect modification pertains to how the causal effect of one exposure changes across different levels of a second exposure. For example, “How does the effect of heat change across different levels of humidity?”. Let T refer to heat, H to humidity and Y represent the outcome of interest such as heat-related death. \\(Y^t\\) is the counterfactual outcome under exposure t and \\(Y^{th}\\) is the counterfactual outcome under t and h. Humidity (H) is effect modifier on the risk difference scale for the effect of heat (T) on the outcome (Y) if H is not affected by T and there are two levels of T (\\(t_0\\),\\(t_1\\)) and two levels of H (\\(h_0\\),\\(h_1\\)), such that: \\[ Ε[Y^{t_1}│H=h_1] - E[Y^{t_0}│H=h_1] ≠ E[Y^{t_1}|H=h_0]- E[Y^{t_0}|H=h_0] \\] Effect modification indicates that the effect of heat on the outcome differs across different levels of humidity. By recognizing effect modification, public health interventions can better address how heat exposure interacts with humidity. This enables more targeted strategies to mitigate and adapt health risks associated with specific combinations of heat and humidity. There is an interaction on the risk difference scale between heat (T) and humidity (H) on the outcome (Y) if there are two levels of T (\\(t_0\\),\\(t_1\\)) and two levels of H (\\(h_0\\),\\(h_1\\)), such that: \\[ Ε[Y^{t_1, h_1}] - E[Y^{t_0, h_1}] ≠ E[Y^{t_1, h_0}]- E[Y^{t_0, h_0}] \\] Interaction requires that the joint effect of heat and humidity is different from the sum of their individual effects. If interaction is present, studying each exposure separately may not fully capture the complexity of their joint influence on the outcome. (VanderWeele (2009)) According to Baldwin and colleagues, analytical approaches to estimate interaction of effect modification are similar. They suggest that by including interaction terms or effect modifiers the main question of interest needs to be considered same as the scale of interest and the potential policy implications. (Baldwin et al. (2023)) Unfortunately, the interpretation of interaction terms and effect modifiers often leads to misinterpretation and often the scale (multiplicative or additive) also is not considered correctly. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the concepts of interaction and effect modification and how to interpret them correctly. 11.3.5 Data Limitations The availability and quality of weather data vary across different locations all over the world. Low-income countries, like for example most african regions, often have limited access to weather data compared to high-income countries due to limited resources for data collection. Figure 3 illustrates global sub-daily weather data from the HadISD data source. This highlights the inconsistency in data coverage. Many regions in Africa, South America, and Australia have few measurements compared to Europe or the US. Such a lack of data, especially in areas prone to extreme heat events leaves gaps in our understanding and estimation of weather-related impacts on health outcomes. Tropical and subtropical climates are characterized by high levels of humidity and heat. Unfortunately, these climates are particularly affected by these data limitations. Missing data in tropical and subtropical regions hinder our ability to comprehend the combined effects of heat and humidity on health outcomes. Therefore, epidemiological studies often do not include locations where humidity plays a significant role due to these data gaps. Another challenge is the temporal resolution of weather data. Many studies rely on daily mean measurements, which may overlook fluctuations in heat and humidity throughout the day. It is known that heat and humidity fluctuate throughout the day. Using daily mean measurements may underestimate the effects of heat and humidity. Furthermore, correlations between heat and humidity can vary depending on the time of day, potentially impacting the findings of epidemiological studies. Furthermore, typically weather stations are situated outside urban areas, often at airports. This may not capture urban heat effects. Additionally, as most measurements are taken outdoors, indoor and outdoor variations in heat and humidity are not accounted for. Another limitation is that typically only relative humidity (RH) is measured at weather stations. This may not provide the most accurate representation of humidity. Deriving mass-based variables like specific or absolute humidity from RH may introduce uncertainties and bias in the estimates as menioned earlier. In summary, the lack of weather data can result in an underestimation of the impact of humidity on health outcomes. Researchers should consider these data limitations, especially when generalizing results to different countries and weather conditions. (Baldwin et al. (2023)) Figure 3: Station coverage and length of record in HadISD (Raymond (2024)) 11.4 Examples Armstrong et al. conducted a study to assess the impact of heat and humidity on daily mortality during summer months. They used a time series regression model with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DNLM) for heat, using data from 445 cities across 24 countries. Numerous different models were fitted, including different humidity levels and terms and further one model with an interaction term between heat and humidity was modeled. Model comparison using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) revealed that the best fit was achieved when humidity was included as a linear term, i.e., as confounder. One very surprisingly result was that a 23% increase in relative humidity at the 99th percentile was associated with a 1.1% decrease in mortality. This was a non-significant finding contrary to the expectation that humidity leads to an increase in mortality. Sensitivity analyses involving specific humidity and dewpoint yielded similar results. Considering humidity as a potential effect modifier, by including an interaction term, was not favored based on AIC criteria (Armstrong B. (2019)). Baldwin et al. criticize solely rely on AIC to determine whether an interaction term should be included in the model. Consequently, as no interaction term was used in the final model, the influence remains uncertain and raises questions about the value of its exclusion. The final model used by Armstrong et al. included relative humidity as a linear term, thereby treating humidity as a confounder. As highlighted earlier, employing humidity as a confounder can introduce several challenges. Armstrong et al.recognized some limitations of their study. They discussed the data gaps from tropical and less developed countries, the exclusive consideration of mortality as an endpoint, and the possibility of missing the association between humidity and mortality under specific conditions (Armstrong B. (2019)). In another epidemiological study from Schwartz et al. the effect of heat and humidity on hospital admissions for heart disease and myocardial infarction among individuals over 64 years from 12 US cities was investigated. They fitted a Poisson model for each city, incorporating regression splines to control for season and barometric pressure, and adjusting for the day of the week. Despite their broad approach, they found no evidence of an effect of humidity on hospital admissions. Possible explanations for this results are the use of relative humidity and the resulting bias. Further, considering humidity as a confounder may also explain that no effect of humidity was found. Additionally, focusing solely on individuals older than 64, who are more vulnerable to heat and sweating impairments, may have biased the study’s findings. (Joel Schwartz (2004)) Barreca conducted a study that found an effect of heat and humidity on mortality rates in the US. He used data from the Global Summary of the Day (GSOD) files, which provide detailed weather station data. The study analyzed data from 1973 to 2002, calculating specific humidity using a standard meteorological formula based on mean dew point and mean station pressure. To estimate the effects of heat and humidity, Barreca employed an ordinary-least-squares model with the following equation: \\[ MORT_{cmy} = \\sum_b \\beta^b*TEMP^b_{cmy} + \\sum_{b&#39;} \\alpha^{b&#39;} * HUMID^{b&#39;}_{cmy} + X_{cmy} \\gamma + \\mu_{my} + \\\\ \\phi_{cm} + \\delta_{cm} * TIME + \\pi_{cm}*TIME^2 + \\epsilon_{kym} \\] In this model: MORT represents the monthly mortality rate (per 100,000 inhabitants) in county c, year y and calendar month m. TEMP is a set of temperature variables indicating the fraction of days county c experiences mean temperatures within specific 10 °F bins (e.g., 50–60 °F). HUMID is a set of humidity variables indicating the fraction of days county c experiences mean humidity levels within specific two-grams-of-water-vapor bins (e.g., 2–4 g/kg). X is a vector of controls for precipitation and temperature-humidity interaction terms. \\(\\mu\\) represents unrestricted time effects. \\(\\phi\\) represents unrestricted county by calendar month fixed effects. \\(\\delta_{cm}*TIME\\) and \\(\\pi_{cm} * TIME^2\\) represent unrestricted county by calendar month quadratic time trends. Barreca clustered the standard errors by the state of residence to account for the possibility that \\(\\epsilon\\) is correlated within states, both across counties and over time. Additionally, the equation was weighted by the county population in 2000. He fitted different models: one model included only temperature, and another included only humidity. Both the temperature-mortality and humidity-mortality relationships followed a similar pattern. In a subsequent model, he included both TEMP and HUMID covariates. An interesting finding from this model was that both cold temperatures and low humidity levels remained significant determinants of mortality. Finally, he fitted a model with an interaction term between heat and humidity. The estimates from this model suggest that increasing humidity levels are more dangerous at high temperatures. Therefore, controlling for humidity is according to Barreca particularily important in the context of predicting distributional effects of climate change. (Barreca (2012)) In a separate review, Budd examined the history and limitations of the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index, widely used since its development for the United States Army and Marine Corps in 1950. The index incorporates air temperature, mean radiant temperature, absolute humidity, and air movement as basic elements of the thermal environment. Budd identifies several limitations of the index, including its underestimation of stress in environments with restricted evaporation, challenges in interpreting its results, and limitations in the accuracy of sweat measurement due to calibration methods and instrumentation. (M.Budd (2008)) 11.5 Discussion The discrepancies observed in epidemiological studies regarding the impact of humidity on health outcomes may stem from various factors. It is important to understand how to appropriately use humidity in study designs and recognize the different humidity definitions. Prioritizing mass water-vapor based variables such as specific or absolute humidity over relative humidity is a crucial step. As discussed earlier, humidity can be considered as a confounder, effect modifier, in an interaction term with heat or component of a composite index. Each of these considerations of humidity comes with its own set of limitations. It is essential to provide a clear research question or hypothesis when evaluating the role of humidity in studies. Researchers must be mindful of these considerations to ensure the robustness and validity of their study results. Efforts to improve data collection are required, especially to include regions with tropical climates and low-income countries that are often underrepresented in studies. Additionally, relying solely on vulnerable populations may introduce bias, underscoring the importance of striving for a representative sample. Humidity represents an intriguing factor worth studying further, along with heat, especially in studies investigating health effects. Planning and executing appropriate studies to examine the effects of heat and humidity requires a nuanced understanding of humidity. It is appropriate incorporation into models, and knowledge aware of potential limitations and errors.

Introduction It is widely recognized that climate change (CC) is impacting both economy and society. However, it is also increasingly acknowledged as critical factor influencing various aspects of human health. In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared CC as one of the largest threads to human health of the twenty-first century and recognised the need for a research agenda to understand complex linkages between climate change and health (World Health Organization 2009). In following years, initiatives such as the Lancet Countdown, a global monitoring system designed to track research and support policy decisions on Health and CC, drew resources and attention to this pressing problem (Watts, Amann, Ayeb-Karlsson, et al. 2018). Despite these efforts, some health conditions are still little researched and the impact of climate change on them is poorly understood. Among them are mental health (MH) and human well-being (Romanello, Napoli, et al. 2023). According to the OECD, 20-30% of the working population are affected by a MH condition. Mental disorders are the worldwide leading cause of years lived with disability Hewlett, E. and Moran, V. (2014) and a considerable burden not only for individuals but also society and economy. In 2010, the direct and indirect costs were estimated to amount to 2493 billion US dollars worldwide (Hewlett, E. and Moran, V. 2014) and the lost economic value amounts to 4-8% of GDP in different regions (Arias, Saxena, and Verguet 2022). However, health care systems spend a disproportional amount on treatment. In England, MH conditions make out about 26% of the burden of disease, but only 13% of health expenditure are attributed to treatment (Hewlett, E. and Moran, V. 2014). Globally, 80% of people do not get sufficient treatment at all (World Health Organization 2021). Given the proportion of MH in global burden of disease, it seems surprising that little research has investigated how CC might affect MH. The aim of this chapter is to outline the challenges in researching the impact of CC on MH and to present research approaches on this topic. Emphasis will be placed on the methodological and statistical difficulties. 13.2 2. Challenges of Quantifying Climate Change Impact on Mental Health Important to notice is that CC does not directly impact MH, but rather the consequences of a changing climate, like the increase in magnitude, frequency and intensity of extreme climate events mediate the effect of CC on MH (Hayes et al. 2018). The Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) report identified multiple pathways how CC could impact MH. The direct pathway includes exposure to traumatic events such as floods, hurricanes or other severe weather-related events. The indirect pathway consists of the consequences of prolonged events such as drought or sea level rise that lead to displacement, food shortages or economic hardship. The last pathway, vicarious exposure or overarching/diffuse exposure refers to the long-term emotional distress caused by the awareness of the negative consequences of CC and the associated feelings of helplessness and despair (Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change 2023). Although in the IPCC report most of the adverse effects of CC on MH are assessed with “very high confidence”, no concrete projections are given as to how many additional people will suffer from mental disorders. This is peculiar because for other health effects that are assessed with very high confidence, figures for additionally affected individuals are given (Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change 2023). The discrepancy between confidence and tangible figures is caused by multiple challenges of attributing CC to MH, which can be clustered in external and internal difficulties. The external difficulties of quantification mainly consist of the globally insufficient resources devoted to monitoring and treating MH. Although the Lancet Countdown emphasised the need to integrate MH in future CC health considerations, only five out of 16 countries included MH in their health adaption plans (Watts, Amann, Arnell, et al. 2018). In the most recent Countdown report it was noted that the development of an indicator to cover the relations between CC and MH is still ongoing (Romanello, Napoli, et al. 2023). One major problems hereby is that current prevalence estimates for mental illnesses are unreliable, as mental illness is severely underdiagnosed, especially in third world countries (World Health Organization 2021). With the lack of a baseline, good projection estimates are difficult. The internal difficulties of quantification evolve around the complex nature of MH itself. Hayes et al. (2018) identified four key aspects which complicate the estimation of CC impact: Firstly, the risk of pathologizing normal stress responses due to a changing climate while adverse mental health outcomes are underdiagnosed. Secondly, multiple causal pathways in which one CC correlate can influence different MH outcomes. Thirdly, effects of CC may only become apparent after a considerable time period, which complicates the investigation of causal effects. Lastly, existing complex interactions between MH and other social determinants of health, and their relationship with CC, is insufficiently understood. Figure 1. Causal process diagram of the impact of drought on the mental health outcomes depression, anxiety and suicide. Numbers in brackets are number of papers meeting the search criteria for each factor. Figure adapted from Vins et al. (2015). The four aspects can be illustrated by a causal process diagram, shown in Figure 1, which depicts the multiple pathways by which droughts can influence MH outcomes (Vins et al. 2015). Most apparent is the economic route: Droughts have a negative impact on crop yield, influencing employment and financial stability in the agricultural sector. Financial hardship has been shown to have a negative impact on MH, leading to depression and, in severe cases, even suicide Edwards, Gray, and Hunter (2015). Another causal route is the one concerned with the decreased availability of food, leading to dietary changes or famine. This can directly influence neurodevelopment of children or anxiety in adults, but also indirectly cause migration, which can lead to social isolation and loss of cultural identity, again having a negative impact on MH outcomes. To estimate the impact of droughts on MH e. g. via the migration route, it would require not only to estimate the increase and severity of droughts due to CC, but also how much migration this would cause and how many of the affected individuals would consequently develop a mental illness. This is a genuine challenge for accurate climate projections, as estimation of migration movements and the development of mental illness depend on many interrelated factors (Mazhin et al. 2020). Some individual linkages between events (e. g. the influence of economic hardship on MH) are well-researched. Future research needs to integrate these pathways and link them to different climate scenarios to better understand the overall causal processes and make accurate projections possible (Vins et al. 2015). 13.3 3. Data Sources and Methods Used to Investigate Climate Change Impact To enable evidence-based policies to protect health from climate change, the WHO has identified five research priorities: (i) Assessing risks with data-based studies and, in a second step, projections and modelling, (ii) identifying the most effective interventions, (iii) guiding health-promoting mitigation and adaption decisions in other sectors, (iv) improving decision-support and (v) estimating costs (World Health Organization 2009). While this research agenda has advanced in relation to some health outcomes, research on MH and CC is almost exclusively concerned with the first step of the first priority (Cianconi, Betrò, and Janiri 2020). Methods used to describe future MH risks vary, but most quantitative studies can be grouped into a few broad categories relating to the data and measurement instruments, the study design and the statistical analysis applied (Charlson et al. 2021). The two main data sources are either official statistics or (representative) surveys. Official statistics such as mortality data or hospitalisation rates are low in cost for the researcher and have the advantage of being more objective than self-assessment questionnaires or interviews. But there are some considerable downsides. Some health outcomes, e. g. suicide rates, are often underreported, especially in countries where there is high stigmatisation. Furthermore, proxy variables sometimes have to replace variables of interest. For example, when examining the impact of drought on farmer suicide rates, occupation is not captured in the mortality statistics and one is limited to analysing rural males aged 30-60 years, assuming that they are working in agriculture (Carleton 2017). Surveys do not have this downside, as one can collect variables of interest and potential confounders directly, leading to more fine-grained information (Edwards, Gray, and Hunter 2015). However, survey data is more prone to self-selection bias and dropouts, particularly in longitudinal designs (Kessler et al. 2008). In addition, measuring instruments can have a low validity and data collection is costly in terms of both time and monetary resources. Which data source is chosen is largely dependent on the research question and study design. The most common study designs are cross-sectional, followed by case-studies. Little studies attempt to model outcomes (Charlson et al. 2021). The specific statistical analysis depends on the data source and the study design. Classic linear regression (in case of a continuous outcome, e. g. general wellbeing) and logit models (in case of binary outcome, e. g. has a mental illness – does not have a mental illness) are most often used, but also more flexible models, allowing for non-linear effects of climatic covariates such as temperature or precipitation, are possible. For a more detailed review on studies about environmental exposure and MH outcomes, see Charlson et al. (2021). It can be summarized that research concerning the impact of CC on MH is less advanced than research on other health outcomes and mostly restricted to assessing risks. A methodological difficulty inherent to research questions regarding MH is firstly the measurement of MH outcomes, relying on psychometric instruments or diagnostic interviews, and secondly the large number of potential unmeasured confounders, especially when working with official statistics. An important motivation for researching the interactions between CC and health is that, based on a good understanding of causality and reliable projections, evidence-based measures can contribute to the adaptation of health care systems and prevent the most adverse outcomes. However, in the most frequently used cross-sectional studies on CC and MH, causal interpretations must be carefully scrutinised, particularly when dealing with complex causal processes. Different designs such as longitudinal or interventional designs, a shift towards the other WHO research priorities ii)-v) and a greater focus on non-western regions and populations may contribute to a more reliable, causal understanding. 13.4 4. The Impact of Hurricanes on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) To illustrate how the above theoretical principals are operationalised in practice, an exemplary study and its results will be described in the following. The paper “Trends in Mental Illness and Suicidality after Hurricane Katrina” (Kessler et al. 2008) is concerned with the impact of one of the most destructive natural catastrophes in the history of the United States (Graumann et al. 2006). To investigate the effect on MH, 815 pre-hurricane residents of the most affected areas were interviewed 5-8 months after the event (baseline) and again one year later (follow-up). In these interviews, data on hurricane-related stressors, demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, household income, education, etc.) and different MH conditions (anxiety and mood disorders, PTSD, suicidality, severity of mental illness) were collected. As the first screening interview found that individuals with higher hurricane-related stress levels chose to not participate in the study, weights were applied to the baseline hurricane-related stress variable to account for this selection bias. Additionally, the authors differentiated between individuals from the New Orleans Metropolitan area (metro subsample) and individuals from other areas (non-metro subsample). Multiple logistic regression models of the form \\[ \\pi_i = P(Y_i = \\text{mental illness} \\mid \\eta_i) = h(\\eta_i) = \\frac{\\exp(\\eta_i)}{1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)} \\] with linear predictors \\[ \\eta_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i2} + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_{ip} \\] were used to investigate the different outcomes of mental illnesses. In the following, only the results of the outcome of PTSD shall be outlined. The overall prevalence of PTSD was high in both subsamples and on both measurement points (14.9% on baseline, 20.9% on follow-up for the total sample), compared to the US-wide prevalence of 6% (Goldstein et al. 2016). A two-tailed, within-responded paired t-test showed that prevalence increased significantly over time. Significance was driven by increase of prevalence in the non-metro subsample (11.8 vs 20.0%, p &lt; 0.001), while the prevalence of the metro-subsample stagnated over time (25.9 vs 24.1%, p = 0.37). Recovery rate in the follow-up was low as 66.4% of baseline cases continued to have PTSD, 16.9% classified for another diagnosis and only 16.7% recovered. In the logistic regression model, only two of the demographic variables, participants age and family income, had a significant influence on PTSD outcome. The authors hypothesised that the significant increase in prevalence might be explained by an increase in hurricane-related stress. However, this hypothesis was not confirmed by the data. Regarding hurricane-related stress as outcome variable, one can find that stress decreased significantly over time in the whole sample (91.7 vs 57.5%, p = 0.001), but in the follow-up, stress was significantly higher in the metro subsample than the non-metro subsample (78.3 vs 51.7%, p &lt; 0.001). This contrasts with the increase of PTSD in the non-metro subsample. One can conclude that higher levels of residual hurricane-related stress cannot explain the increase of PTSD prevalence over time in the non-metro subsample. In turn, when taking hurricane-related stress of the follow-up into the model as a predictor variable, one can find that it is indeed significant for both subsamples. In this final model, stress exposure was a key predictor which explained substantial variation in PTSD. The results can be seen in Table 1. Remarkable are the odds-ratios of 20.3 for severe and 12.8 for serious stress compared to individuals with no hurricane-related stress, after controlling for socio-demographic variables and diagnosis of PTSD in the baseline interview. The authors argue that, if interpreted causally, the population-attributable risk proportion of PTSD due to hurricane-related stress is 31.9%, meaning that this proportion would be expected to remit if all hurricane-related stress would be resolved. Although the causality assumption may not be fulfilled, this statement is interesting as it could be a methodological approach to estimate additional PTSD diagnoses due to natural disasters. TABLE 13.1: Table 1. Effects of hurricane-related stress on PTSD outcome as shown in Kessler et al. (2008). Severity OR CI Severe 20.3* (4.9–84.6) Serious 12.8* (3.0–53.7) Moderate 4.4* (1.2–16.1) Mild 3.5 (1.0–12.6) None 1.0 \\(\\chi^2\\) (\\(p\\)-value) 21.0 (&lt; .001) Note. CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder. Effects estimated with multiple logistic regression model controlling for sociodemographic variables, baseline value of PTSD and subsample. Reference category were participants with no hurricane-related stress. Significance level was 0.05. The study has four mayor limitations: First, in addition to the mentioned selection bias after the first screening, the dropout rate between measurement points was 21.9%. Although a weight was used to account for the selection bias, it is possible that other, non-collected variables might influence participation or dropout. Second, only screening scales instead of diagnostic interviews were used for diagnosis. Hurricane-related stress was measured using self-assessment questionnaires, which is both subjective and retrospective and possibly biased by current emotional functioning. Third, although interpreted causally, hurricane-related stress and PTSD might be influenced by unmeasured common causes, influencing the observed association. Lastly, there is no true pre-hurricane baseline for the sample, and preexisting mental illness was not recorded in the survey. The results of the presented study are partially contradicting similar studies which found a decline in PTSD over time (Chen and Liu 2015). The authors hypothesise that the increase in prevalence in the non-metro subsample may be caused by greater media attention and resources being allocated to the New Orleans metropolitan region, leading to a sense of neglect and slower reconstruction of infrastructure in other areas. It is also remarked that other stressors only indirectly linked to the hurricane, such as economic stress or displacement, might influence MH outcomes. This is an interesting point of discussion, as it shows that the IPCC categorization of climate change exposures impacting MH is not as simple as outlined before. Events that fall into the category of direct exposure, such as hurricanes, might have prolonged effects on mental health outcomes, e. g. via economic hardship. This in turn makes it very difficult to attribute MH outcomes to specific CC events, as effects can be observed directly after the event, but can also have a prolonged onset. The potential causal pathways of short-term and long-term stressors on PTSD are depicted in Figure 2. Figure 2. Potential direct and indirect causal pathways through which hurricanes might influence the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To conclude, the study shows that disaster-related stress does play a significant role in PTSD outcome. Since adverse effects are only weakly related to socio-demographic variables, efforts for sufficient treatment must extend to the entire population. High residual hurricane-related stress after two years and its strong relation to PTSD emphasizes the need for evidence-based measures to address residual stress in multiple ways, ranging from rebuilding infrastructure to providing counselling and financial support. Although the study itself does not link the results to CC, it would be possible to draw a connection between this single, natural disaster and future CC impact on MH. According to the IPCC (2023), hurricanes are projected to increase in frequency and severity. If, as claimed in the study, hurricane-related stress plays a causal role in the development of PTSD, this increase in hurricanes would have a considerable effect on the number of individuals suffering from PTSD and would need to be taken into account for future health care adaption plans. 13.5 5. Adaption and Mitigation Strategies Although the IPCC classifies the adverse impact of CC on MH to be of very high confidence, little attention has been directed to mitigation and adaption strategies for mental health and treatment systems (Charlson et al. 2021). In Berry et al. (2018), a possible approach to deal with the high complexity of the matter is outlined. They criticise that today’s policies and epidemiological research is focused mainly on individual outcomes, proximate causes and measurements on short timescales. To address the impact of CC on MH more holistically, they propose “systems thinking”, which they define as a set of skills used to examine interacting factors that produce outcomes, predict their behaviour and design interventions. More precisely, in research they demand a mixture of CC projections and experimental designs to understand causal influences. In policy, behaviour change should be accomplished through social policy and collective actions instead of aiming at individuals. In direct actions and interventions, they demand a shift from the single-hazard perspective of e. g. extreme weather events to a strategic long-term planning accounting for an increase in those extreme events (Berry et al. 2018). An example for system thinking would be the protection of infrastructure to benefit MH. This sounds far-fetched, but considering that the cost of damage to critical infrastructure is estimated to increase tenfold (Forzieri et al. 2018), and that these costs divert resources from public health, put pressure on the functioning of society and take up individual resources – all factors that have a negative impact on MH – infrastructure protection could be a promotional strategy to protect MH from the impact of CC. The causal diagram of this process is depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3. Top-level process diagramm depicting linkages between climate change, infratructure and mental health, as shown in Berry et al. (2018). The proposal by Berry et al. (2018) is a broad framework that may be useful to approach most of the problems discussed in this chapter. However, the individual components are yet to be tested in future research and policy designs. On the more practical side, Hayes et al. (2018) and Newnham et al. (2020) proposed several practical measures that could protect MH from direct and indirect CC impact. For acute response to disaster, first-aid responders and nurses need to be trained in basic psychological first aid. It has also proven beneficial for subsequent MH outcomes to prepare people living in vulnerable areas (e.g. near rivers that will flood more frequently in the future) for the possibility that the event might occur (Munro et al. 2017). Intermediate adaption could include capacity building for therapy and counselling, education and programmes to reduce stigma as well as community-building and preparation training for extreme weather-related events (Newnham, Titov, and McEvoy 2020). Long-term prevention and mitigation require governments to include MH in their strategic health planning and the development of tools to predict risks, costs and needed resources. Ultimately, a swift transition towards a carbon-neutral economy would be the most cost-effective and efficient way of protecting MH from the impacts of CC. 13.6 6. Conclusion Climate change will have considerable effects on public health, including MH and wellbeing. As the latter has received little attention in research and politics, scientifically sound methods to quantify the impact of CC on MH are still being developed and research has yet not advanced from assessing the risks to estimating the costs or designing adaption strategies. Considering the importance of MH and wellbeing for individual life as well as society and economic production, more research and policy action is needed to understand this complex topic and prevent or at least attenuate the adverse impact of a changing climate on mental health.
